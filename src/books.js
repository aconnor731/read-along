export const books = `THEAETETUSPlato has much to say in other dialogues about knowledge, but this is his only
sustained inquiry into the question ‘What isknowledge?’ As such, it is the
founding document of what has come to be known as ‘epistemology’, as one of
the branches of philosophy; its inﬂuence on Greek epistemology—in Aristotle
and the Stoics particularly—is strongly marked. Theaetetus was a famous
mathematician, Plato’s associate for many years in the Academy; the dialogue’s
prologue seems to announce the work as published in his memory, shortly after
his early death on military service in 369 B.C.We can therefore date the publica-
tion of Theaetetus fairly precisely, to the few years immediately following
Theaetetus’ death. Plato was then about sixty years of age, and another famous
longtime associate, Aristotle, was just joining the Academy as a student (367).
Though it is not counted as a ‘Socratic’ dialogue—one depicting Socrates in-
quiring into moral questions by examining and refuting the opinions of his fel-
low discussants— Theaetetus depicts a Socrates who makes much of his own
ignorance and his subordinate position as questioner, and the dialogue con-
cludes inconclusively. Socrates now describes his role, however, as he does not
in the ‘Socratic’ dialogues, as that of a ‘midwife’: he brings to expression ideas
of clever young men like Theaetetus, extensively develops their presuppositions
and consequences so as to see clearly what the ideas amount to, and then estab-
lishes them as sound or defective by independent arguments of his own. The
ﬁrst of Theaetetus’ three successive deﬁnitions of knowledge—that knowledge is
‘perception’—is not ﬁnally ‘brought to birth’ until Socrates has linked it to Pro-
tagoras’ famous ‘man is the measure’ doctrine of relativistic truth, and also to
the theory that ‘all is motion and change’ that Socrates ﬁnds most Greek think-
ers of the past had accepted, and until he has ﬁtted it out with an elaborate
and ingenious theory of perception and how it works. He then examines sepa-
rately the truth of these linked doctrines—introduced into the discussion by
him, not Theaetetus—and, in ﬁnally rejecting Theaetetus’ idea as unsound, he
advances his own positive analysis of perception and its role in knowledge.
This emphasis on the systematic exploration of ideas before ﬁnally committing
oneself to them or rejecting them as unsound is found in a different guise in
Parmenides, with its systematic exploration of hypotheses about unity as a
means of working hard toward an acceptable theory of Forms. Socrates estab-
lishes a clear link between the two dialogues when, at 183e, he drags in a refer-
ence back to the conversation reported in Parmenides.
Theaetetus has a unique format among Plato’s dialogues. The prologue
gives a brief conversation between Euclides and Terpsion, Socratics from
157158 Theaetetus
nearby Megara (they are among those present for the discussion on Socrates’
last day in Phaedo). For the remainder, a slave reads out a book composed by
Euclides containing a conversation of Socrates, Theodorus, and Theaetetus that
took place many years previously. Since ancient sources tell us of Socratic dia-
logues actually published by Euclides, it is as if, except for the prologue, Plato
is giving us under his own name one of Euclides’ dialogues! The last line of
the work establishes it as the ﬁrst of a series, with Sophist andStatesman to
follow —as noted above, Parmenides precedes. In Theaetetus Socrates tests
Theaetetus’ mettle with the geometer Theodorus’ aid and in the presence of his
namesake Socrates, another associate of Plato’s in the Academy; in the other
two works, ﬁrst Theaetetus, then young Socrates will be discussion partners
with an unnamed visitor from Elea, in Southern Italy, home to Parmenides
and Zeno —a very different type of partner. Socrates and his midwifery are su-
perseded.
Despite its lively and intellectually playful Socrates, reminiscent of the ‘So-
cratic’ dialogues, Theaetetus is a difﬁcult work of abstract philosophical the-
ory. The American logician and philosopher C. S. Peirce counted it, along with
Parmenides, as Plato’s greatest work, and more recently it has attracted favor-
able attention from such major philosophers as Ludwig Wittgenstein and Gil-
bert Ryle.J.M.C.
EUCLIDES : Are you only just in from the country, Terpsion? Or have you 142
been here some time?
TERPSION : I’ve been here a good while. In fact, I have been looking for
you in the market-place and wondering that I couldn’t ﬁnd you.
EUCLIDES : Well, you couldn’t, because I was not in the city.
TERPSION : Where have you been, then?
EUCLIDES : I went down to the harbor; and as I was going, I met Theaetetus,
being taken to Athens from the camp at Corinth.
TERPSION : Alive or dead?
EUCLIDES : Alive; but that’s about all one could say. Badly wounded for b
one thing; but the real trouble is this sickness that has broken out in
the army.
TERPSION : Dysentery?
EUCLIDES : Yes.
TERPSION : What a man to lose!
EUCLIDES : Yes. A ﬁne man, Terpsion. Only just now I was listening to
some people singing his praises for the way he behaved in the battle.
TERPSION : Well, there’s nothing extraordinary about that. Much more to
be wondered at if he hadn’t distinguished himself. But why didn’t he put c
up here at Megara?
Translated by M. J. Levett, revised by Myles Burnyeat.Theaetetus 159
EUCLIDES : He was in a hurry to get home. I kept asking him myself, and
advising him; but he wouldn’t. So I saw him on his way. And as I was
coming back, I thought of Socrates and what a remarkably good prophet
he was —as usual —about Theaetetus. It was not long before his death, if
I remember rightly, that he came across Theaetetus, who was a boy at the
time. Socrates met him and had a talk with him, and was very much struck
with his natural ability; and when I went to Athens, he repeated to me
the discussion they had had, which was well worth listening to. And he d
said to me then that we should inevitably hear more of Theaetetus, if he
lived to grow up.
TERPSION : Well, he appears to have been right enough. —But what was
this discussion? Could you tell it to me?
EUCLIDES : Good Lord, no. Not from memory, anyway. But I made some 143
notes of it at the time, as soon as I got home; then afterwards I recalled
it at my leisure and wrote it out, and whenever I went to Athens, I used
to ask Socrates about the points I couldn’t remember, and correct my
version when I got home. The result is that I have got pretty well the
whole discussion in writing.
TERPSION : Yes, of course. I have heard you say that before, and I have
always been meaning to ask you to show it to me, though I have been so
long about it. But is there any reason why we shouldn’t go through it
now? I want a rest, in any case, after my journey in from the country.
EUCLIDES : Well, I shouldn’t mind sitting down either. I saw Theaetetus as b
faras Erineum.Comealong. Wewillgetthe slavetoread ittous whilewerest.
TERPSION : Right.
EUCLIDES : This is the book, Terpsion. You see, I have written it out like
this: I have not made Socrates relate the conversation as he related it to
me, but I represent him as speaking directly to the persons with whom
he said he had this conversation. (These were, he told me, Theodorus the
geometer and Theaetetus.) I wanted, in the written version, to avoid the c
bother of having the bits of narrative in between the speeches —I mean,
when Socrates, whenever he mentions his own part in the discussion, says
‘And I maintained’ or‘I said,’ or, of the person answering, ‘He agreed’ or
‘He would not admit this.’ That is why I have made him talk directly to
them and have left out these formulae.
TERPSION : Well, that’s quite in order, Euclides.
EUCLIDES : Now, boy, let us have it.
SOCRATES : If Cyrene were ﬁrst in my affections, Theodorus, I should be d
asking you how things are there, and whether any of your young people
are taking up geometry or any other branch of philosophy. But, as it is, I
love Athens better than Cyrene, and so I’m more anxious to know which
of our young men show signs of turning out well. That, of course, is what
I am always trying to ﬁnd out myself, as best I can; and I keep asking
other people too —anyone round whom I see the young men are inclined
to gather. Now you, of course, are very much sought after, and with good160 Theaetetus
reason; your geometry alone entitles you to it, and that is not your only e
claim. So if you have come across anyone worth mentioning, I should be
glad to hear.
THEODORUS : Well, Socrates, I think you ought to be told, and I think I
ought to tell you, about a remarkable boy I have met here, one of your
fellow countrymen. And if he were beautiful, I should be extremely nervous
of speaking of him with enthusiasm, for fear I might be suspected of being
in love with him. But as a matter of fact —if you’ll excuse my saying such
a thing —he is not beautiful at all, but is rather like you, snub-nosed, with
eyes that stick out; though these features are not quite so pronounced in
him. I speak without any qualms; and I assure you that among all the 144
people I have ever met —and I have got to know a good many in my
time —I have never yet seen anyone so amazingly gifted. Along with a
quickness beyond the capacity of most people, he has an unusually gentle
temper; and, to crown it all, he is as manly a boy as any of his fellows. I
never thought such a combination could exist; I don’t see it arising else-
where. People as acute and keen and retentive as he is are apt to be very
unbalanced. They get swept along with a rush, like ships without ballast; b
what stands for courage in their makeup is a kind of mad excitement;
while, on the other hand, the steadier sort of people are apt to come to
their studies with minds that are sluggish, somehow —freighted with a
bad memory. But this boy approaches his studies in a smooth, sure, effective
way, and with great good temper; it reminds one of the quiet ﬂow of a
stream of oil. The result is that it is astonishing to see how he gets through
his work, at his age.
SOCRATES : That is good news. And he is an Athenian —whose son is he?
THEODORUS : I have heard the name, but I don’t remember it. But he is c
the middle one of this group coming toward us. He and his companions
were greasing themselves outside just now; it looks as if they have ﬁnished
and are coming in here. But look and see if you recognize him.
SOCRATES : Yes, I know him. He’s the son of Euphronius of Sunium —
very much the kind of person, my friend, that you tell me his son is. A
distinguished man in many ways; he left a considerable property too. But
I don’t know the boy’s name.
THEODORUS : His name, Socrates, is Theaetetus. As for the property, that, I d
think, has been made away with by trustees. All the same, he is wonderfully
open-handed about money, Socrates.
SOCRATES : A thoroughbred, evidently. I wish you would ask him to come
and sit with us over here.
THEODORUS : All right. Theaetetus, come here beside Socrates.
SOCRATES : Yes, come along, Theaetetus. I want to see for myself what
sort of a face I have. Theodorus says I am like you. But look. If you and e
I had each had a lyre, and Theodorus had told us that they were both
similarly tuned, should we have taken his word for it straightaway? Or
should we have tried to ﬁnd out if he was speaking with any expert
knowledge of music?Theaetetus 161
THEAETETUS : Oh, we should have inquired into that.
SOCRATES : And if we had found that he was a musician, we should have
believed what he said; but if we found he had no such qualiﬁcation, we
should have put no faith in him.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s true.
SOCRATES : And now, I suppose, if we are interested in this question of
our faces being alike, we ought to consider whether he is speaking with 145
any knowledge of drawing or not?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I should think so.
SOCRATES : Then is Theodorus an artist?
THEAETETUS : No, not so far as I know.
SOCRATES : Nor a geometer, either?
THEAETETUS : Oh, there’s no doubt about his being that, Socrates.
SOCRATES : And isn’t he also a master of astronomy and arithmetic and
music —of all that an educated man should know?
THEAETETUS : Well, he seems to me to be.
SOCRATES : Then if he asserts that there is some physical resemblance
between us —whether complimenting us or the reverse —one ought not to
pay much attention to him?
THEAETETUS : No, perhaps not.
SOCRATES : But supposing it were the soul of one of us that he was b
praising? Suppose he said one of us was good and wise? Oughtn’t the
one who heard that to be very anxious to examine the object of such praise?
And oughtn’t the other to be very willing to show himself off?
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly, Socrates.
SOCRATES : Then, my dear Theaetetus, now is the time for you to show
yourself and for me to examine you. For although Theodorus often gives
meﬂattering testimonials for people, both Athenians and foreigners, I
assure you I have never before heard him praise anybody in the way he c
has just praised you.
THEAETETUS : That’s all very well, Socrates; but take care he wasn’t saying
that for a joke.
SOCRATES : That is not Theodorus’ way. Now don’t you try to get out of
what we have agreed upon with the pretence that our friend is joking, or
you may make it necessary for him to give his evidence —since no charge
of perjury is ever likely to be brought against him. So have the pluck to
stand by your agreement.
THEAETETUS : All right, I must, then, if that’s what you’ve decided.
SOCRATES : Tell me now. You are learning some geometry from Theodorus,
I expect?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I am.
SOCRATES : And some astronomy and music and arithmetic? d
THEAETETUS : Well, I’m very anxious to, anyway.
SOCRATES : And so am I, my son —from Theodorus or from anyone who
seems to me to know about these things. But although I get on with them
pretty well in most ways, I have a small difﬁculty, which I think ought to162 Theaetetus
be investigated, with your help and that of the rest of the company. —
Now isn’t it true that to learn is to become wiser1about the thing one
is learning?
THEAETETUS : Yes, of course.
SOCRATES : And what makes men wise, I take it, is wisdom?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : And is this in any way different from knowledge? e
THEAETETUS : What?
SOCRATES : Wisdom. Isn’t it the things which they know that men are
wise about?
THEAETETUS : Well, yes.
SOCRATES : So knowledge and wisdom will be the same thing?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Now this is just where my difﬁculty comes in. I can’t get a
proper grasp of what on earth knowledge really is. Could we manage to 146
put it into words? What do all of you say? Who’ll speak ﬁrst? Anyone
who makes a mistake shall sit down and be Donkey, as the children say
when they are playing ball; and anyone who comes through without a
miss shall be King and make us answer any question he likes. —Well, why
this silence? Theodorus, I hope my love of argument is not making me
forget my manners —just because I’m so anxious to start a discussion and
get us all friendly and talkative together?
THEODORUS : No, no, Socrates —that’s the last thing one could call forget- b
ting your manners. But do make one of the young people answer you. I
am not used to this kind of discussion, and I’m too old to get into the way
of it. But it would be suitable enough for them and they would proﬁt more
by it. For youth can always proﬁt, that’s true enough. So do go on; don’t
let Theaetetus off but ask him some more questions.
SOCRATES : Well, Theaetetus, you hear what Theodorus says. You won’t
want to disobey him, I’m sure; and certainly a wise man shouldn’tb e c
disobeyed by his juniors in matters of this kind —it wouldn’t be at all the
proper thing. Now give me a good frank answer. What do you think
knowledge is?
THEAETETUS : Well, I ought to answer, Socrates, as you and Theodorus
tell me to. In any case, you and he will put me right, if I make a mistake.
SOCRATES : We certainly will, if we can.
THEAETETUS : Then I think that the things Theodorus teaches are knowl-
edge —I mean geometry and the subjects you enumerated just now. Then d
again there are the crafts such as cobbling, whether you take them together
or separately. They must be knowledge, surely.
SOCRATES : That is certainly a frank and indeed a generous answer, my
dear lad. I asked you for one thing and you have given me many; I wanted
something simple, and I have got a variety.
1. The words ‘wise’ and ‘wisdom’ in the argument which begins here represent the
Greek sophos and sophia. The point of the argument will come across more naturally in
English if readers substitute in their mind the words ‘expert’ and ‘expertise’.Theaetetus 163
THEAETETUS : And what does that mean, Socrates?
SOCRATES : Nothing, I dare say. But I’ll tell you what I think. When you
talk about cobbling, you mean just knowledge of the making of shoes?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s all I mean by it.
SOCRATES : And when you talk about carpentering, you mean simply the e
knowledge of the making of wooden furniture?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s all I mean, again.
SOCRATES : And in both cases you are putting into your deﬁnition what
the knowledge is of?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But that is not what you were asked, Theaetetus. You were
not asked to say what one may have knowledge of, or how many branches
of knowledge there are. It was not with any idea of counting these up that
the question was asked; we wanted to know what knowledge itself is. —
Or am I talking nonsense?
THEAETETUS : No, you are perfectly right.
SOCRATES : Now think about this too. Supposing we were asked about 147
some commonplace, everyday thing; for example, what is clay? And sup-
posing we were to answer, ‘clay of the potters’ and‘clay of the stovemakers’
and ‘clay of the brickmakers’, wouldn’t that be absurd of us?
THEAETETUS : Well, perhaps it would.
SOCRATES : Absurd to begin with, I suppose, to imagine that the person
who asked the question would understand anything from our answer
when we say ‘clay’, whether we add that it is dollmakers’ clay or any b
other craftsman’s. Or do you think that anyone can understand the name
of a thing when he doesn’t know what the thing is?
THEAETETUS : No, certainly not.
SOCRATES : And so a man who does not know what knowledge is will
not understand ‘knowledge of shoes’ either?
THEAETETUS : No, he won’t.
SOCRATES : Then a man who is ignorant of what knowledge is will not
understand what cobbling is, or any other craft?
THEAETETUS : That is so.
SOCRATES : So when the question raised is ‘What is knowledge?’, to reply
by naming one of the crafts is an absurd answer; because it points out c
something that knowledge is of when this is not what the question was
about.
THEAETETUS : So it seems.
SOCRATES : Again, it goes no end of a long way round, in a case where,
I take it, a short and commonplace answer is possible. In the question
about clay, for example, it would presumably be possible to make the
simple, commonplace statement that it is earth mixed with liquid, and let
the question of whose clay it is take care of itself.
THEAETETUS : That seems easier, Socrates, now you put it like that. But I
believe you’re asking just the sort of question that occurred to your name- d
sake Socrates here and myself, when we were having a discussion a little
while ago.164 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : And what was that, Theaetetus?
THEAETETUS : Theodorus here was demonstrating to us with the aid of
diagrams a point about powers.2He was showing us that the power of three
square feet and the power of ﬁve square feet are not commensurable in length
with the power of one square foot; and he went on in this way, taking each
case in turn till he came to the power of seventeen square feet; there for some
reason he stopped. So the idea occurred to us that, since the powers were
turning out to be unlimited in number, we might try to collect the powers in
question under one term, which would apply to them all. e
SOCRATES : And did you ﬁnd the kind of thing you wanted?
THEAETETUS : I think we did. But I’d like you to see if it’s all right.
SOCRATES : Go on, then.
THEAETETUS : We divided all numbers into two classes. Any number
which can be produced by the multiplication of two equal numbers, we
compared to a square in shape, and we called this a square or equilat-
eral number.
SOCRATES : Good, so far.
THEAETETUS : Then we took the intermediate numbers, such as three and 148
ﬁve and any number which can’t be produced by multiplication of two
equals but only by multiplying together a greater and a less; a number
such that it is always contained by a greater and a less side. A number of
this kind we compared to an oblong ﬁgure, and called it an oblong number.
SOCRATES : That’s excellent. But how did you go on?
THEAETETUS :W ed e ﬁned under the term ‘length’ any line which produces
in square an equilateral plane number; while any line which produces in
square an oblong number we deﬁned under the term ‘power’, for the
reason that although it is incommensurable with the former in length, it b
is commensurable in the plane ﬁgures which they respectively have the
2.‘Powers’ is a mathematical term for squares. By contrast, at 148a –b‘power’ is given
a new, specially deﬁned use to denominate a species of line, viz. the incommensurable
lines for which the boys wanted a general account. It may be useful to give a brief
explanation of the mathematics of the passage.
Two lines are incommensurable if and only if they have no common measure; that
is, no unit of length will measure both without remainder. Two squares are incommensu-
rable in length if and only if their sides are incommensurable lines; the areas themselves
may still be commensurable, i.e., both measurable by some unit of area, as is mentioned
at 148b. When Theodorus showed for a series of powers (squares) that each is incommen-
surable in length with the one foot (unit) square, we can think of him as proving case
by case the irrationality of √3,√5 ,...√17. But this was not how he thought of it himself.
Greek mathematicians did not recognize irrational numbers but treated of irrational
quantities as geometrical entities: in this instance, lines identi ﬁed by the areas of the
squares that can be constructed on them. Similarly, we can think of the boys’ formula
for powers or square lines at 148a –b as making the point that, for any positive integer
n,√nis irrational if and only if there is no positive integer msuch that n=m ×m. But,
once again, a Greek mathematician would think of this generalization in the geometrical
terms in which Theaetetus expounds it.Theaetetus 165
power to produce. And there is another distinction of the same sort with
regard to solids.
SOCRATES : Excellent, my boys. I don’t think Theodorus is likely to be
had up for false witness.
THEAETETUS : And yet, Socrates, I shouldn’t be able to answer your ques-
tion about knowledge in the same way that I answered the one about
lengths and powers —though you seem to me to be looking for something
of the same sort. So Theodorus turns out a false witness after all.
SOCRATES : Well, but suppose now it was your running he had praised; c
suppose he had said that he had never met anyone among the young
people who was such a runner as you. And then suppose you were beaten
by the champion runner in his prime —would you think Theodorus’ praise
had lost any of its truth?
THEAETETUS : No, I shouldn’t.
SOCRATES : But do you think the discovery of what knowledge is is really
what I was saying just now —a small thing? Don’t you think that’sa
problem for the people at the top?
THEAETETUS : Yes, rather, I do; and the very topmost of them.
SOCRATES : Then do have conﬁdence in yourself and try to believe that
Theodorus knew what he was talking about. You must put your whole d
heart into what we are doing —in particular into this matter of getting a
statement of what knowledge really is.
THEAETETUS : If putting one’s heart into it is all that is required, Socrates,
the answer will come to light.
SOCRATES : Go on, then. You gave us a good lead just now. Try to imitate
your answer about the powers. There you brought together the many
powers within a single form; now I want you in the same way to give one
single account of the many branches of knowledge.
THEAETETUS : But I assure you, Socrates, I have often tried to think this e
out, when I have heard reports of the questions you ask. But I can never
persuade myself that anything I say will really do; and I never hear anyone
else state the matter in the way that you require. And yet, again, you
know, I can’t even stop worrying about it.
SOCRATES : Yes; those are the pains of labor, dear Theaetetus. It is because
you are not barren but pregnant.
THEAETETUS : I don’t know about that, Socrates. I’m only telling you
what’s happened to me.
SOCRATES : Then do you mean to say you’ve never heard about my being 149
the son of a good hefty midwife, Phaenarete?3
THEAETETUS : Oh, yes, I’ve heard that before.
SOCRATES : And haven’t you ever been told that I practice the same
art myself?
THEAETETUS : No, I certainly haven’t.
3. The name means ‘She who brings virtue to light’.166 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : But I do, believe me. Only don’t give me away to the rest of
the world, will you? You see, my friend, it is a secret that I have this art.
That is not one of the things you hear people saying about me, because
they don’t know; but they do say that I am a very odd sort of person, always
causing people to get into difﬁculties. You must have heard that, surely?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I have. b
SOCRATES : And shall I tell you what is the explanation of that?
THEAETETUS : Yes, please do.
SOCRATES : Well, if you will just think of the general facts about the
business of midwifery, you will see more easily what I mean. You know,
I suppose, that women never practice as midwives while they are still
conceiving and bearing children themselves. It is only those who are past
child-bearing who take this up.
THEAETETUS : Oh, yes.
SOCRATES : They say it was Artemis who was responsible for this custom;
it was because she, who undertook the patronage of childbirth, was herself c
childless. She didn’t, it’s true, entrust the duties of midwifery to barren
women, because human nature is too weak to acquire skill where it has
no experience. But she assigned the task to those who have become incapa-
ble of child-bearing through age —honoring their likeness to herself.
THEAETETUS : Yes, naturally.
SOCRATES : And this too is very natural, isn’t it? —or perhaps necessary?
I mean that it is the midwives who can tell better than anyone else whether
women are pregnant or not.
THEAETETUS : Yes, of course.
SOCRATES : And then it is the midwives who have the power to bring on d
the pains, and also, if they think ﬁt, to relieve them; they do it by the use
of simple drugs, and by singing incantations. In difﬁcult cases, too, they
can bring about the birth; or, if they consider it advisable, they can promote
a miscarriage.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that is so.
SOCRATES : There’s another thing too. Have you noticed this about them,
that they are the cleverest of match-makers, because they are marvellously
knowing about the kind of couples whose marriage will produce the
best children?
THEAETETUS : No, that is not at all familiar to me.
SOCRATES : But they are far prouder of this, believe me, than of cutting
the umbilical cord. Think now. There’s an art which is concerned with the e
cultivation and harvesting of the crops. Now is it the same art which
prescribes the best soil for planting or sowing a given crop? Or is it a
different one?
THEAETETUS : No, it is all the same art.
SOCRATES : Then applying this to women, will there be one art of the
sowing and another of the harvesting?
THEAETETUS : That doesn’t seem likely, certainly.Theaetetus 167
SOCRATES : No, it doesn’t. But there is also an unlawful and unscientiﬁc 150
practice of bringing men and women together, which we call procuring;
and because of that the midwives —a most august body of women —are
very reluctant to undertake even lawful matchmaking. They are afraid
that if they practice this, they may be suspected of the other. And yet, I
suppose, reliable matchmaking is a matter for no one but the true midwife.
THEAETETUS : Apparently.
SOCRATES : So the work of the midwives is a highly important one; but
it is not so important as my own performance. And for this reason, that
there is not in midwifery the further complication, that the patients are b
sometimes delivered of phantoms and sometimes of realities, and that the
two are hard to distinguish. If there were, then the midwife’s greatest and
noblest function would be to distinguish the true from the false offspring —
don’t you agree?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I do.
SOCRATES : Now my art of midwifery is just like theirs in most respects.
The difference is that I attend men and not women, and that I watch over
the labor of their souls, not of their bodies. And the most important thing c
about my art is the ability to apply all possible tests to the offspring, to
determine whether the young mind is being delivered of a phantom, that
is, an error, or a fertile truth. For one thing which I have in common with
the ordinary midwives is that I myself am barren of wisdom. The common
reproach against me is that I am always asking questions of other people
but never express my own views about anything, because there is no
wisdom in me; and that is true enough. And the reason of it is this, that
God compels me to attend the travail of others, but has forbidden me to
procreate. So that I am not in any sense a wise man; I cannot claim as the d
child of my own soul any discovery worth the name of wisdom. But with
those who associate with me it is different. At ﬁrst some of them may give
the impression of being ignorant and stupid; but as time goes on and our
association continues, all whom God permits are seen to make progress —
a progress which is amazing both to other people and to themselves. And
yet it is clear that this is not due to anything they have learned from me;
it is that they discover within themselves a multitude of beautiful things,
which they bring forth into the light. But it is I, with God’s help, who
deliver them of this offspring. And a proof of this may be seen in the e
many cases where people who did not realize this fact took all the credit
to themselves and thought that I was no good. They have then proceeded
to leave me sooner than they should, either of their own accord or through
the inﬂuence of others. And after they have gone away from me they have
resorted to harmful company, with the result that what remained within
them has miscarried; while they have neglected the children I helped them
to bring forth, and lost them, because they set more value upon lies and
phantoms than upon the truth; ﬁnally they have been set down for ignorant
fools, both by themselves and by everybody else. One of these people was 151168 Theaetetus
Aristides the son of Lysimachus;4and there have been very many others.
Sometimes they come back, wanting my company again, and ready to
move heaven and earth to get it. When that happens, in some cases the
divine sign that visits me forbids me to associate with them; in others, it
permits me, and then they begin again to make progress.
There is another point also in which those who associate with me are
like women in child-birth. They suffer the pains of labor, and are ﬁlled
day and night with distress; indeed they suffer far more than women. And
this pain my art is able to bring on, and also to allay.
Well, that’s what happens to them; but at times, Theaetetus, I come b
across people who do not seem to me somehow to be pregnant. Then I
realize that they have no need of me, and with the best will in the world
I undertake the business of match-making; and I think I am good enough —
God willing —at guessing with whom they might proﬁtably keep company.
Many of them I have given away to Prodicus;5and a great number also
to other wise and inspired persons.
Well, my dear lad, this has been a long yarn; but the reason was that I
have a suspicion that you (as you think yourself) are pregnant and in
labor. So I want you to come to me as to one who is both the son of a c
midwife and himself skilled in the art; and try to answer the questions I
shall ask you as well as you can. And when I examine what you say, I
may perhaps think it is a phantom and not truth, and proceed to take it
quietly from you and abandon it. Now if this happens, you mustn’t get
savage with me, like a mother over her ﬁrst-born child. Do you know,
people have often before now got into such a state with me as to be literally
ready to bite when I take away some nonsense or other from them. They
never believe that I am doing this in all goodwill; they are so far from
realizing that no God can wish evil to man, and that even I don’t do this d
kind of thing out of malice, but because it is not permitted to me to accept
a lie and put away truth.
So begin again, Theaetetus, and try to say what knowledge is. And don’t
on any account tell me that you can’t. For if God is willing, and you play
the man, you can.
THEAETETUS : Well, Socrates, after such encouragement from you, it would
hardly be decent for anyone not to try his hardest to say what he has in e
him. Very well then. It seems to me that a man who knows something
perceives what he knows, and the way it appears at present, at any rate,
is that knowledge is simply perception.
SOCRATES : There’s a good frank answer, my son. That’s the way to speak
one’s mind. But come now, let us look at this thing together, and see
whether what we have here is really fertile or a mere wind-egg. You hold
that knowledge is perception?
4. Aristides is one of the two young men whose education Socrates discusses in Laches
(see 178a –179b).
5. A famous Sophist. See Protagoras 315d, 337a –c, 340e –341c, 358a –b.Theaetetus 169
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But look here, this is no ordinary account of knowledge you’ve
come out with: it’s what Protagoras used to maintain. He said the very 152
same thing, only he put it in rather a different way. For he says, you know,
that ‘Man is the measure of all things: of the things which are, that they
are, and of the things which are not, that they are not.’ You have read
this, of course?
THEAETETUS : Yes, often.
SOCRATES : Then you know that he puts it something like this, that as
each thing appears to me, so it is for me, and as it appears to you, so it
is for you —you and I each being a man?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that is what he says.
SOCRATES : Well, it is not likely that a wise man would talk nonsense. So b
let us follow him up. Now doesn’t it sometimes happen that when the
same wind is blowing, one of us feels cold and the other not? Or that one
of us feels rather cold and the other very cold?
THEAETETUS : That certainly does happen.
SOCRATES : Well then, in that case are we going to say that the wind itself,
by itself, is cold or not cold? Or shall we listen to Protagoras, and say it
is cold for the one who feels cold, and for the other, not cold?
THEAETETUS : It looks as if we must say that.
SOCRATES : And this is how it appears to each of us?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But this expression ‘it appears’ means ‘he perceives it’?
THEAETETUS : Yes, it does.
SOCRATES : The appearing of things, then, is the same as perception, in c
the case of hot and things like that. So it results, apparently, that things
are for the individual such as he perceives them.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that seems all right.
SOCRATES : Perception, then, is always of what is, and unerring —as be-
ﬁts knowledge.
THEAETETUS : So it appears.
SOCRATES : But, I say, look here. Was Protagoras one of those omniscient
people? Did he perhaps put this out as a riddle for the common crowd of
us, while he revealed the Truth6as a secret doctrine to his own pupils?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean by that, Socrates? d
SOCRATES :I’ll tell you; and this, now, is certainly no ordinary theory —
I mean the theory that there is nothing which in itself is just one thing:
nothing which you could rightly call anything or any kind of thing. If you
call a thing large, it will reveal itself as small, and if you call it heavy, it
is liable to appear as light, and so on with everything, because nothing is
one or anything or any kind of thing. What is really true, is this: the things
of which we naturally say that they ’are’, are in process of coming to be, e
6. Protagoras of Abdera was a ﬁfth century B.C.philosopher and sophist; this appears
to have been the title of his book.170 Theaetetus
as the result of movement and change and blending with one another. We
are wrong when we say they ‘are’, since nothing ever is, but everything
is coming to be.
And as regards this point of view, let us take it as a fact that all the
wise men of the past, with the exception of Parmenides, stand together.
Let us take it that we ﬁnd on this side Protagoras and Heraclitus and
Empedocles; and also the masters of the two kinds of poetry, Epicharmus
in comedy and Homer in tragedy.7For when Homer talked about ‘Ocean,
begetter of gods, and Tethys their mother’, he made all things the offspring
ofﬂux and motion.8—Or don’t you think he meant that?
THEAETETUS : Oh, I think he did.
SOCRATES : And if anyone proceeded to dispute the ﬁeld with an army 153
like that —an army led by Homer —he could hardly help making a fool of
himself, could he?
THEAETETUS : It would not be an easy matter, Socrates.
SOCRATES : It would not, Theaetetus. You see, there is good enough evi-
dence for this theory that being (what passes for such) and becoming are
a product of motion, while not-being and passing-away result from a state
of rest. There is evidence for it in the fact that heat or ﬁre, which presumably
generates and controls everything else, is itself generated out of movement
and friction —these being motions. —Or am I wrong in saying these are
the original sources of ﬁre?
THEAETETUS : Oh no, they certainly are. b
SOCRATES : Moreover, the growth of living creatures depends upon these
same sources?
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly.
SOCRATES : And isn’t it also true that bodily condition deteriorates with
rest and idleness? While by exertion and motion it can be preserved for
a long time?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : And what about the condition of the soul? Isn’t it by learning
and study, which are motions, that the soul gains knowledge and is pre-
served9and becomes a better thing? Whereas in a state of rest, that is, c
when it will not study or learn, it not only fails to acquire knowledge but
forgets what it has already learned?
7. Heraclitus was famous for holding that ‘everything ﬂows’ (cf. 179d ff.). Empedocles
described a cosmic cycle in which things are constituted and dissolved by the coming
together and separating of the four elements earth, air, ﬁre, and water. Epicharmus made
humorous use of the idea that everything is always changing by having a debtor claim
he is not the same person as incurred the debt. Parmenides remains outside the chorus
of agreement because he held that the only reality is one single, completely changeless
thing (cf. 183e).
8.Iliad xiv.201, 302.
9. The Greek could equally be translated ‘that the soul gains and preserves knowledge’;
the reader may perhaps be expected to hear the clause both ways.Theaetetus 171
THEAETETUS : That certainly is so.
SOCRATES : And so we may say that the one thing, that is, motion, is
beneﬁcial to both body and soul, while the other has the opposite effect?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s what it looks like.
SOCRATES : Yes, and I might go on to point out to you the effect of such
conditions as still weather on land and calms on the sea. I might show you
how these conditions rot and destroy things, while the opposite conditions
make for preservation. And ﬁnally, to put the crown on my argument, I
might bring in Homer’s golden cord,10and maintain that he means by this
simply the sun; and is here explaining that so long as the revolution d
continues and the sun is in motion, all things are and are preserved, both
in heaven and in earth, but that if all this should be ‘bound fast’,a si t
were, and come to a standstill, all things would be destroyed and, as the
saying goes, the world would be turned upside down. Do you agree
with this?
THEAETETUS : Yes, Socrates, I think that is the meaning of the passage.
SOCRATES : Then, my friend, you must understand our theory in this way.
In the sphere of vision, to begin with, what you would naturally call a
white color is not itself a distinct entity, either outside your eyes or in e
your eyes. You must not assign it any particular place; for then, of course
it would be standing at its post; it wouldn’t be in process of becoming.
THEAETETUS : But what do you mean?
SOCRATES : Let us follow what we stated a moment ago, and posit that
there is nothing which is, in itself, one thing. According to this theory,
black or white or any other color will turn out to have come into being
through the impact of the eye upon the appropriate motion; and what we
naturally call a particular color is neither that which impinges nor that 154
which is impinged upon, but something which has come into being be-
tween the two, and which is private to the individual percipient. —Or
would you be prepared to insist that every color appears to a dog, or to
any other animal, the same as it appears to you?
THEAETETUS : No, I most certainly shouldn’t.
SOCRATES : Well, and do you even feel sure that anything appears to
another human being like it appears to you? Wouldn’t you be much more
disposed to hold that it doesn’t appear the same even to yourself because
you never remain like yourself?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that seems to me nearer the truth than the other.
SOCRATES : Well now, supposing such things as size or warmth or white- b
ness really belonged to the object we measure ourselves against or touch,
it would never be found that this object had become different simply by
coming into contact with another thing and without any change in itself.
On the other hand, if you suppose them to belong to what is measuring
10.Iliad viii.17 –27. Zeus boasts that if he pulled on a golden cord let down from heaven,
he could haul up earth, sea and all, bind the cord fast round the peak of Mt. Olympus,
and leave the lot dangling in mid-air.172 Theaetetus
or touching, this again could never become different simply because some-
thing else had come into its neighborhood, or because something had
happened to the ﬁrst thing —nothing having happened to itself. As it is,
you see, we may easily ﬁnd ourselves forced into saying the most astonish-
ing and ridiculous things, as Protagoras would point out or anyone who
undertook to expound the same views.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean? What sort of ridiculous things?
SOCRATES : Let me give you a simple example of what I mean, and you c
will see the rest for yourself. Here are six dice. Put four beside them, and
they are more, we say, than the four, that is, half as many again; but put
twelve beside them, and we say they are less, that is, half the number.
And there is no getting out of that —or do you think there is?
THEAETETUS : No, I don’t.
SOCRATES : Well now, supposing Protagoras or anyone else were to ask
you this question: ‘Is it possible, Theaetetus, for any thing to become bigger
or more in number in any other way than by being increased?’ What is d
your answer to that?
THEAETETUS : Well, Socrates, if I answer what seems true in relation to
the present question, I shall say ‘No, it is not possible’; but if I consider
it in relation to the question that went before, then in order to avoid
contradicting myself, I say ‘Yes, it is.’
SOCRATES : That’s a good answer, my friend, by Jove it is; you are inspired.
But, I think, if you answer ‘Yes’, it will be like that episode in Euripides —
the tongue will be safe from refutation but the mind will not.11
THEAETETUS : That’s true.
SOCRATES : Now if you and I were professional savants, who had already
analyzed all the contents of our minds, we should now spend our super-
ﬂuous time trying each other out; we should start a regular Sophists ’set- e
to, with a great clashing of argument on argument. But, as it is, we are
only plain men; and so our ﬁrst aim will be to look at our thoughts
themselves in relation to themselves, and see what they are —whether, in
our opinion, they agree with one another or are entirely at variance.
THEAETETUS : That would certainly be my aim, anyway.
SOCRATES : And mine. That being so, as we are not in any way pressed
for time, don’t you think the thing to do is to reconsider this matter quietly 155
and patiently, in all seriousness ‘analyzing’ ourselves, and asking what
are these apparitions within us? —And when we come to review them, I
suppose we may begin with the statement that nothing can possibly have
become either greater or less, in bulk or in number, so long as it is equal
to itself. Isn’t that so?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Secondly, we should say that a thing to which nothing is added
and from which nothing is taken away neither increases nor diminishes but
remains equal.
11. Cf. Hippolytus 612.Theaetetus 173
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly.
SOCRATES : Thirdly, that it is impossible that a thing should ever be b
what it was not before without having become and without any process
of becoming?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I think so.
SOCRATES : Now it seems to me that these three statements that we have
admitted are ﬁghting one another in our souls when we speak of the
example of the dice; or when we say that, within the space of a year, I (a
full-grown man) without having been either increased or diminished, am
now bigger than you (who are only a boy) and, later on, smaller —though
I have lost nothing and it is only that you have grown. For this means c
that I am, at a later stage, what I was not before, and that, too, without
having become —for without becoming it is not possible to have become,
and without suffering any loss in size I could never become less. And
there are innumerable other examples of the same thing if once we admit
these. You follow me, I take it, Theaetetus —I think you must be familiar
with this kind of puzzle.
THEAETETUS : Oh yes, indeed, Socrates, I often wonder like mad what
these things can mean; sometimes when I’m looking at them I begin to
feel quite giddy.
SOCRATES : I dare say you do, my dear boy. It seems that Theodorus was d
not far from the truth when he guessed what kind of person you are. For
this is an experience which is characteristic of a philosopher, this wonder-
ing: this is where philosophy begins and nowhere else. And the man who
made Iris the child of Thaumas was perhaps no bad genealogist.12—But
aren’t you beginning to see now what is the explanation of these puzzles,
according to the theory which we are attributing to Protagoras?
THEAETETUS : I don’t think I am, yet.
SOCRATES : Then I dare say you will be grateful to me if I help you to e
discover the veiled truth in the thought of a great man —or perhaps I
should say, of great men?
THEAETETUS : Of course I shall be, Socrates, very grateful.
SOCRATES : Then you have a look round, and see that none of the uniniti-
ated are listening to us —I mean the people who think that nothing exists
but what they can grasp with both hands; people who refuse to admit
that actions and processes and the invisible world in general have any
place in reality.
THEAETETUS : They must be tough, hard fellows, Socrates. 156
SOCRATES : They are, my son —very crude people. But these others, whose
mysteries I am going to tell you, are a much more subtle type. These
mysteries begin from the principle on which all that we have just been
saying also depends, namely, that everything is really motion, and there
is nothing but motion. Motion has two forms, each an inﬁnite multitude,
12.Theogony 265. ‘Thaumas’ means wonder, while Iris, the messenger of the gods, is
the rainbow which passes between earth and heaven.174 Theaetetus
but distinguished by their powers, the one being active and the other
passive. And through the intercourse and mutual friction of these two
there comes to be an offspring inﬁnite in multitude but always twin births, b
on the one hand what is perceived, on the other, the perception of it, the
perception in every case being generated together with what is perceived
and emerging along with it. For the perceptions we have such names as
sight, hearing, smelling, feeling cold and feeling hot; also what are called
pleasures and pains, desires and fears; and there are others besides, a great
number which have names, an inﬁnite number which have not. And on
the other side there is the race of things perceived, for each of these
perceptions perceived things born of the same parentage, for all kinds of c
visions all kinds of colors, for all kinds of hearings all kinds of sounds;
and so on, for the other perceptions the other things perceived, that come
to be in kinship with them.
Now what does this tale really mean, from our point of view, Theaetetus?
How does it bear on what we were saying before? Do you see?
THEAETETUS : Not really, Socrates.
SOCRATES : Look here, then, let us see if we can somehow round it off.
What it is trying to express, presumably, is this. All these things are in
motion, just as we say; and their motion is distinguished by its swiftness
or slowness. What is slow has its motion in one and the same place, and
in relation to the things in the immediate neighborhood; in this way it d
generates and the offspring are swifter, as they move through space, and
their motion takes the form of spatial movement.
Thus the eye and some other thing —one of the things commensurate
with the eye —which has come into its neighborhood, generate both white-
ness and the perception which is by nature united with it (things which
would never have come to be if it had been anything else that eye or object
approached). In this event, motions arise in the intervening space, sight e
from the side of the eye and whiteness from the side of that which cooper-
ates in the production of the color. The eye is ﬁlled with sight; at that
moment it sees, and becomes not indeed sight, but a seeing eye; while its
partner in the process of producing color is ﬁlled with whiteness, and
becomes not whiteness but white, a white stick or stone or whatever it is
that happens to be colored this sort of color.
We must understand this account as applying in the same way to hard 157
and hot and everything else: nothing, as we were saying before, isin itself
any of these. All of them, of all kinds whatsoever, are what things become
through association with one another, as the result of motion. For even in
the case of the active and passive motions it is impossible, as they say, for
thought, taking them singly, to pin them down to being anything. There
is no passive till it meets the active, no active except in conjunction with
the passive; and what, in conjunction with one thing, is active, reveals
itself as passive when it falls in with something else.
And so, wherever you turn, there is nothing, as we said at the outset,
which in itself is just one thing; all things become relatively to something. bTheaetetus 175
The verb ‘to be’ must be totally abolished —though indeed we have been
led by habit and ignorance into using it ourselves more than once, even
in what we have just been saying. That is wrong, these wise men tell us,
nor should we allow the use of such words as ‘something’, ‘of something’,
or‘mine’, ‘this’ or‘that’, or any other name that makes things stand still.
We ought, rather, to speak according to nature and refer to things as
‘becoming’, ‘being produced’, ‘passing away’, ‘changing’; for if you speak
in such a way as to make things stand still, you will easily be refuted.
And this applies in speaking both of the individual case and of many
aggregated together —such an aggregate, I mean, as people call ‘man’ or c
‘stone’, or to which they give the names of the different animals and sorts
of thing.
—Well, Theaetetus, does this look to you a tempting meal and could
you take a bite of the delicious stuff?
THEAETETUS : I really don’t know, Socrates. I can’t even quite see what
you’re getting at —whether the things you are saying are what you think
yourself, or whether you are just trying me out.
SOCRATES : You are forgetting, my friend. I don’t know anything about
this kind of thing myself, and I don’t claim any of it as my own. I am
barren of theories; my business is to attend you in your labor. So I chant
incantations over you and offer you little tidbits from each of the wise till d
I succeed in assisting you to bring your own belief forth into the light.
When it has been born, I shall consider whether it is fertile or a wind-egg.
But you must have courage and patience; answer like a man whatever
appears to you about the things I ask you.
THEAETETUS : All right, go on with the questions.
SOCRATES : Tell me again, then, whether you like the suggestion that good
and beautiful and all the things we were just speaking of cannot be said
to‘be’ anything, but are always ‘coming to be’.13
THEAETETUS : Well, as far as I’m concerned, while I’m listening to your
exposition of it, it seems to me an extraordinarily reasonable view; and I
feel that the way you have set out the matter has got to be accepted.
SOCRATES : In that case, we had better not pass over any point where our e
theory is still incomplete. What we have not yet discussed is the question
of dreams, and of insanity and other diseases; also what is called mishearing
or misseeing or other cases of misperceiving. You realize, I suppose, that
it would be generally agreed that all these cases appear to provide a
refutation of the theory we have just expounded. For in these conditions, 158
we surely have false perceptions. Here it is far from being true that all
things which appear to the individual also are. On the contrary, no one
of the things which appear to him really is.
THEAETETUS : That is perfectly true, Socrates.
13. An alternative translation would be: ‘the suggestion that nothing is, but rather
becomes, good, beautiful or any of the things we were speaking of just now ’.176 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : Well then, my lad, what argument is left for the person who
maintains that knowledge is perception and that what appears to any
individual also is, for him to whom it appears to be?
THEAETETUS : Well, Socrates, I hardly like to tell you that I don’t know
what to say, seeing I’ve just got into trouble with you for that. But I really b
shouldn’t know how to dispute the suggestion that a madman believes
what is false when he thinks he is a god; or a dreamer when he imagines
he has wings and is ﬂying in his sleep.
SOCRATES : But there’s a point here which isa matter of dispute, especially
as regards dreams and real life —don’t you see?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
SOCRATES : There’s a question you must often have heard people ask —
the question what evidence we could offer if we were asked whether in
the present instance, at this moment, we are asleep and dreaming all our c
thoughts, or awake and talking to each other in real life.
THEAETETUS : Yes, Socrates, it certainly is difﬁcult to ﬁnd the proof we
want here. The two states seem to correspond in all their characteristics.
There is nothing to prevent us from thinking when we are asleep that we
are having the very same discussion that we have just had. And when we
dream that we are telling the story of a dream, there is an extraordinary
likeness between the two experiences.
SOCRATES : You see, then, it is not difﬁcult to ﬁnd matter for dispute,
when it is disputed even whether this is real life or a dream. Indeed we d
may say that, as our periods of sleeping and waking are of equal length,
and as in each period the soul contends that the beliefs of the moment are
preeminently true, the result is that for half our lives we assert the reality
of the one set of objects, and for half that of the other set. And we make
our assertions with equal conviction in both cases.
THEAETETUS : That certainly is so.
SOCRATES : And doesn’t the same argument apply in the cases of disease
and madness, except that the periods of time are not equal?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that is so.
SOCRATES : Well now, are we going to ﬁx the limits of truth by the clock?
THEAETETUS : That would be a very funny thing to do. e
SOCRATES : But can you produce some other clear indication to show
which of these beliefs are true?
THEAETETUS : I don’t think I can.
SOCRATES : Then you listen to me and I’ll tell you the kind of thing that
might be said by those people who propose it as a rule that whatever a
man thinks at any time is the truth for him. I can imagine them putting
their position by asking you this question: ‘Now, Theaetetus, suppose you
have something which is an entirely different thing from something else.
Can it have in any respect the same powers as the other thing? ’And
observe, we are not to understand the question to refer to something which
is the same in some respects while it is different in others, but to that
which is wholly different.Theaetetus 177
THEAETETUS : In that case, then, it is impossible that it should have any- 159
thing the same, either as regards its powers or in any other respect, if it
is a completely different thing.
SOCRATES : And aren’t we obliged to admit that such a thing is also unlike
the other?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I think so.
SOCRATES : Now supposing a thing is coming to be like or unlike to
something, whether to itself or to something else; are we to say that when
it is growing like it is coming to be the same, and when it is growing
unlike it is coming to be a different thing?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that must be so.
SOCRATES : Now weren’t we saying, at an earlier stage, that there is a
number —indeed an inﬁnite number —of both active and passive factors?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Also this, that when a thing mixes now with one thing and
now with another, it will not generate the same things each time but
different things?
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly. b
SOCRATES : Well, now let us apply this same statement to you and me
and things in general. Take, for example, Socrates ill and Socrates well.
Shall we say Socrates in health is like or unlike Socrates in sickness?
THEAETETUS : You mean the ill Socrates as a whole compared with the
well Socrates as a whole?
SOCRATES : You get my point excellently; that is just what I mean.
THEAETETUS : Unlike, then, I suppose.
SOCRATES : And different also, in so far as he is unlike?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that follows.
SOCRATES : Similarly, you would say, when he is asleep or in any of the c
conditions we enumerated just now?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I should.
SOCRATES : Then it must surely be true that, when any one of the naturally
active factors ﬁnds Socrates well, it will be dealing with one me, and when
itﬁnds Socrates ill, with a different me?
THEAETETUS : Yes, surely.
SOCRATES : Then in these two events the combination of myself as passive
and it as the active factor will generate different things?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
SOCRATES : Now if I drink wine when I am well, it appears to me pleasant
and sweet?
THEAETETUS : Yes. d
SOCRATES : Going by what we earlier agreed, that is so because the active
and passive factors, moving simultaneously, generate both sweetness and a
perception; on the passive side, the perception makes the tongue percipient,
while on the side of the wine, sweetness moving about it makes it both
be and appear sweet to the healthy tongue.
THEAETETUS : That’s certainly the sense of what we agreed to before.178 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : But when the active factor ﬁnds Socrates ill, then, to begin
with, it is not in strict truth the same man that it gets hold of, is it? Because
here, as we saw, it has come upon an unlike.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Then this pair, Socrates ill and the draft of wine, generates, e
presumably, different things again: a perception of bitterness in the region
of the tongue, and bitterness coming to be and moving in the region of
the wine. And then the wine becomes, not bitterness, but bitter; and I
become, not perception, but percipient.
THEAETETUS : Yes, quite.
SOCRATES : And I shall never again become thus percipient of anything
else. A perception of something else is another perception, and makes 160
another and a changed percipient. Nor again, in the case of that which
acts on me, will it ever, in conjunction with something else, generate the
same thing and itself become such as it now is. From something else it
will generate something else, and itself become a changed thing.
THEAETETUS : That is so.
SOCRATES : Nor will I become such for myself or it such for itself.
THEAETETUS : No.
SOCRATES : But I must necessarily become percipient of something when
I become percipient; it is impossible to become percipient, yet percipient b
of nothing. And it again, when it becomes sweet or bitter or anything of
that kind, must become so for somebody, because it is impossible to become
sweet and yet sweet for no one.
THEAETETUS : Quite impossible.
SOCRATES : It remains, then, that I and it, whether we are or whether we
become, are or become for each other. For our being is, by Necessity’s
decree, tied to a partner; yet we are tied neither to any other thing in the
world nor to our respective selves. It remains, then, that we are tied to
each other. Hence, whether you apply the term ‘being’ to a thing or the
term ‘becoming’, you must always use the words ‘for somebody’ or‘of
something’ or‘relatively to something’. You must not speak of anything
as in itself either being or becoming nor let anyone else use such expres- c
sions. That is the meaning of the theory we have been expounding.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s certainly true, Socrates.
SOCRATES : Then since that which acts on me is for me, and not for anyone
else, it is I who perceive it too, and nobody else?
THEAETETUS : Undoubtedly.
SOCRATES : Then my perception is true for me —because it is always a
perception of that being which is peculiarly mine; and I am judge, as
Protagoras said, of things that are, that they are, for me; and of things that
are not, that they are not.
THEAETETUS : So it seems.
SOCRATES : How then, if I am thus unerring and never stumble in my d
thought about what is —or what is coming to be —how can I fail to be a
knower of the things of which I am a perceiver?
THEAETETUS : There is no way you could fail.Theaetetus 179
SOCRATES : Then that was a grand idea of yours when you told us that
knowledge is nothing more or less than perception. So we ﬁnd the various
theories have converged to the same thing: that of Homer and Heraclitus
and all their tribe, that all things ﬂow like streams; of Protagoras, wisest
of men, that man is the measure of all things; and of Theaetetus that, e
these things being so, knowledge proves to be perception. What about it,
Theaetetus? Shall we say we have here your ﬁrst-born child, the result of
my midwifery? Or what would you say?
THEAETETUS : Oh, there’s no denying it, Socrates.
SOCRATES : This, then, it appears, is what our efforts have at last brought
forth —whatever it really is. And now that it has been born, we must
perform the rite of running round the hearth with it; we must make it in
good earnest go the round of discussion. For we must take care that we
don’t overlook some defect in this thing that is entering into life; it may
be something not worth bringing up, a wind-egg, a falsehood. What do 161
you say? Is it your opinion that your child ought in any case to be brought
up and not exposed to die? Can you bear to see it found fault with, and
not get into a rage if your ﬁrst-born is stolen away from you?
THEODORUS : Theaetetus will put up with it, Socrates. He is not at all one
to lose his temper. But tell me, in Heaven’s name, in what way is it not
as it should be?
SOCRATES : You are the complete lover of discussion, Theodorus, and it
is too good of you to think that I am a sort of bag of arguments, and
can easily pick one out which will show you that this theory is wrong. b
But you don’t realize what is happening. The arguments never come from
me; they always come from the person I am talking to. All that I know,
such as it is, is how to take an argument from someone else —someone
who iswise —and give it a fair reception. So, now, I propose to try
to get our answer out of Theaetetus, not to make any contribution of
my own.
THEODORUS : That’s a better way of putting it, Socrates; do as you say.
SOCRATES : Well then, Theodorus, do you know what astonishes me about
your friend Protagoras?
THEODORUS :N o —what is it? c
SOCRATES : Well, I was delighted with his general statement of the theory
that a thing is for any individual what it seems to him to be; but I was
astonished at the way he began. I was astonished that he did not state at
the beginning of the Truth that ‘Pig is the measure of all things’ or‘Baboon’
or some yet more out-of-the-way creature with the power of perception.
That would have made a most imposing and disdainful opening. It would
have made it clear to us at once that, while we were standing astounded
at his wisdom as though he were a god, he was in reality no better authority d
than a tadpole —let alone any other man.
Or what are we to say, Theodorus? If whatever the individual judges
by means of perception is true for him; if no man can assess another’s
experience better than he, or can claim authority to examine another man’s
judgment and see if it be right or wrong; if, as we have repeatedly said,180 Theaetetus
only the individual himself can judge of his own world, and what he
judges is always true and correct: how could it ever be, my friend, that
Protagoras was a wise man, so wise as to think himself ﬁt to be the teacher e
of other men and worth large fees; while we, in comparison with him the
ignorant ones, needed to go and sit at his feet —we who are ourselves
each the measure of his own wisdom? Can we avoid the conclusion that
Protagoras was just playing to the crowd when he said this? I say nothing
about my own case and my art of midwifery and how silly we look. So
too, I think, does the whole business of philosophical discussion. To exam-
ine and try to refute each other’s appearances and judgments, when each
person’s are correct —this is surely an extremely tiresome piece of nonsense, 162
if the Truth of Protagoras is true, and not merely an oracle speaking in
jest from the impenetrable sanctuary of the book.
THEODORUS : Protagoras was my friend, Socrates, as you have just re-
marked. I could not consent to have him refuted through my admissions;
and yet I should not be prepared to resist you against my own judgment.
So take on Theaetetus again. He seemed to be following you very sympa-
thetically just now.
SOCRATES : Now, Theodorus, supposing you went to Sparta and were b
visiting the wrestling-schools. Would you think it right to sit and watch
other men exercising naked —some of them not much to look at —and
refuse to strip yourself alongside of them, and take your turn of letting
people see what you look like?
THEODORUS : Why not, if I could persuade them to leave the choice to
me? Similarly I am hoping to persuade you to allow me to be a spectator
and not drag me into the arena now that I am grown stiff; but to take on
someone who is younger and more supple.
SOCRATES : Well, Theodorus, what you like I’ll not dislike, as the saying
goes. So we must again resort to our wise Theaetetus. Come, Theaetetus. c
Think, to begin with, of what we have just been saying, and tell me if you
are not yourself astonished at suddenly ﬁnding that you are the equal in
wisdom of any man or even a god? —Or do you think the Protagorean
measure isn’t meant to be applied to gods as much as to men?
THEAETETUS : I most certainly don’t. And, to answer your question, yes,
I am very much astonished. When we were working out the meaning of d
the principle that a thing is for each man what it seems to him to be, it
appeared to me a very sound one. But now, all in a minute, it is quite the
other way round.
SOCRATES : Yes, because you are young, dear lad; and so you lend a ready
ear to mob-oratory and let it convince you. For Protagoras, or anyone
speaking on his behalf, will answer us like this: ‘My good people, young
and old,’ he will say, ‘you sit here orating; you drag in gods, whose e
existence or nonexistence I exclude from all discussion, written or spoken;14
14. A reference to a notorious declaration by Protagoras (Diog. Laert. 9.51): ‘Concerning
gods I am unable to know whether they exist or do not exist, or what they are like inTheaetetus 181
you keep on saying whatever is likely to be acceptable to the mob, telling
them that it would be a shocking thing if no man were wiser than any
cow in a ﬁeld; but of proof or necessity not a word. You just rely on
plausibility; though if Theodorus or any other geometer were to do that
in his branch of science, it’s a good-for-nothing geometer he would be’.
So you and Theodorus had better consider whether, in matters of such
importance, you are going to accept arguments which are merely persua- 163
sive or plausible.
THEAETETUS : You wouldn’t say we had any business to do that, Socrates;
and neither should we.
SOCRATES : Then, it seems, you and Theodorus say our criticism should
take a different line?
THEAETETUS : Yes, it certainly should.
SOCRATES : Here, then, is another way in which we might consider whether
knowledge and perception are the same or different things —for that is
the question which our argument has held in view throughout, isn’t it?
And it was for its sake that we have unearthed all this extraordinary stuff?
THEAETETUS : Undoubtedly.
SOCRATES : Well, now, are we going to agree that when we perceive things b
by seeing or hearing them, we always at the same time know them? Take,
for example, the case of hearing people speaking a foreign language which
we have not yet learned. Are we going to say that we do not hear the
sound of their voices when they speak? Or that we both hear it and know
what they are saying? Again, supposing we do not know our letters, are
we going to insist that we do not see them when we look at them? Or
shall we maintain that, if we see them, we know them?
THEAETETUS : We shall say, Socrates, that we know just that in them which
we see and hear. We both see and know the shape and the color of the
letters; and with the spoken words we both hear and know the rise and c
fall of the voice. But what schoolmasters and interpreters tell us about
them, we don’t perceive by seeing or hearing, and we don’t know, either.
SOCRATES : Very good indeed, Theaetetus; and it would not be right for
me to stand in the way of your progress by raising objections to what you
say. But look, there is another difﬁculty coming upon us. You must think
now how we are going to fend it off.
THEAETETUS : What kind of difﬁculty?
SOCRATES : I mean something like this. Supposing you were asked, ‘If a d
man has once come to know a certain thing, and continues to preserve
the memory of it, is it possible that, at the moment when he remembers
it, he doesn’t know this thing that he is remembering?’ But I am being
long-winded, I’m afraid. What I am trying to ask is, ‘Can a man who has
learned something not know it when he is remembering it?’
THEAETETUS : How could that happen, Socrates? That would be a most
extraordinary thing.
form; for there are many hindrances to knowledge, the obscurity of the subject and the
brevity of human life’.182 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : Then am I perhaps talking nonsense? But think now. You say
that seeing is perceiving and sight is perception?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Then a man who has seen something has come to know that e
which he saw, according to the statement you made just now?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But you do say —don’t you? —that there is such a thing as
memory?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Memory of nothing? Or of something?
THEAETETUS : Of something, surely.
SOCRATES : That is to say, of things which one has learned, that is, per-
ceived —that kind of ‘something’?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
SOCRATES : And what a man has once seen, he recalls, I take it, from time
to time?
THEAETETUS : He does.
SOCRATES : Even if he shuts his eyes? Or does he forget it if he does this?
THEAETETUS : That would be a strange thing to say, Socrates.
SOCRATES : Yet it is what we must say, if we are to save our previous 164
statement. Otherwise, it’s all up with it.
THEAETETUS : Yes, by Jove, I begin to have my suspicions too; but I don’t
quite see it yet. You explain.
SOCRATES : This is why. According to us, the man who sees has acquired
knowledge of what he sees, as sight, perception and knowledge are agreed
to be the same thing.
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly.
SOCRATES : But the man who sees and has acquired knowledge of the
thing he saw, if he shuts his eyes remembers but does not see it. Isn’t that so?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But to say ‘He doesn’t see’ is to say ‘He doesn’t know’,i f b
‘sees’ is‘knows’?
THEAETETUS : True.
SOCRATES : Then we have this result, that a man who has come to know
something and still remembers it doesn’t know it because he doesn’t see
it? And that’s what we said would be a most extraordinary thing to happen.
THEAETETUS : That’s perfectly true.
SOCRATES : Then apparently we get an impossible result when knowledge
and perception are identiﬁed?
THEAETETUS : It looks like it.
SOCRATES : Then we have got to say that perception is one thing and
knowledge another?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I’m afraid so.
SOCRATES : Then what isknowledge? We shall have to begin again at the c
beginning, it seems. And yet —whatever are we thinking about, Theaetetus?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?Theaetetus 183
SOCRATES : We appear to be behaving like a base-born ﬁghting-cock,
jumping away off the theory, and crowing before we have the victory
over it.
THEAETETUS : How are we doing that?
SOCRATES : We seem to have been adopting the methods of professional
controversialists: we’ve made an agreement aimed at getting words to
agree consistently; and we feel complacent now that we have defeated the
theory by the use of a method of this kind. We profess to be philosophers,
not champion controversialists; and we don’t realize that we are doing d
just what those clever fellows do.
THEAETETUS : I still don’t quite see what you mean.
SOCRATES : Well, I will try to explain what I have in mind here. We were
enquiring into the possibility that a man should not know something that
he has learned and remembers. And we showed that a man who has seen
something, and then shuts his eyes, remembers but does not see it; and
that showed that he does not know the thing at the very time that he
remembers it. We said that this was impossible. And so the tale of Protag-
oras comes to an untimely end; yours too, your tale about the identity of
knowledge and perception.
THEAETETUS : So it appears. e
SOCRATES : But I don’t think this would have happened, my friend, if the
father of the other tale were alive. He would ﬁnd plenty of means of
defending it. As things are, it is an orphan we are trampling in the mud.
Not even the people Protagoras appointed its guardians are prepared to
come to its rescue; for instance, Theodorus here. In the interests of justice,
it seems that we shall have to come to the rescue ourselves.
THEODORUS : I think you must. It is not I, you know, Socrates, but Callias, 165
the son of Hipponicus,15who is the guardian of Protagoras’ relicts. As it
happened, I very soon inclined away from abstract discussion to geometry.
But I shall be very grateful if you can rescue the orphan.
SOCRATES : Good, Theodorus. Now will you give your mind to this rescue
work of mine —what little I can do? Because one might be driven into
making even more alarming admissions than we have just made, if one
paid as little attention to the words in which we express our assertions
and denials as we are for the most part accustomed to doing. Shall I tell
you how this might happen? Or shall I tell Theaetetus?
THEODORUS : Tell us both, Socrates; but the younger had better answer.
It will not be so undigniﬁed for him to get tripped up. b
SOCRATES : Well, then, here is the most alarming poser of all. It goes
something like this, I think: ‘Is it possible for a man who knows something
not to know this thing which he knows?’
15. A wealthy Athenian famous for his patronage of the sophists: ‘a man who has spent
more money on sophists than everyone else put together ’(Apology 20a). The discussion
of Plato’s Protagoras is set in his house, where Protagoras and other visiting sophists
are staying.184 Theaetetus
THEODORUS : What are we going to answer now, Theaetetus?
THEAETETUS : That it is impossible, I should think.
SOCRATES : But it is not, if you are going to premise that seeing is knowing.
For what are you going to do when some intrepid fellow has you ‘trapped
in the well-shaft’, as they say, with a question that leaves you no way out:
clapping his hand over one of your eyes, he asks you whether you see his c
cloak with the eye that is covered —how will you cope with that?
THEAETETUS : I shall say that I don’t see it with this one, but I do with
the other.
SOCRATES : So you both see and do not see the same thing at the same time?
THEAETETUS : Well, yes, in that sort of way I do.
SOCRATES :‘That’s not the question I’m setting you,’ he will say, ‘I was
not asking you in what way it happened. I was asking you “Does it happen
that you don’t know what you know?” You now appear to be seeing what
you don’t see; and you have actually admitted that seeing is knowing,
and not to see is not to know. I leave you to draw your conclusion.’
THEAETETUS : Well, I draw a conclusion that contradicts my original sup- d
positions.
SOCRATES : And that is the kind of thing that might have happened to
you more than once, you wonderful fellow. It might have happened if
someone had gone on asking you whether it was possible to know some-
times clearly and sometimes dimly; or to know near at hand and not from
a distance; or to know the same thing both intensely and slightly. And
there are a million other questions with which one of the mercenary skir-
mishers of debate might ambush you, once you had proposed that knowl-
edge and perception are the same thing. He would lay into hearing and
smelling and other perceptions of that kind; and would keep on refuting
you and not let you go till you had been struck with wonder at his e
wisdom —that ‘answer to many prayers’—and had got yourself thoroughly
tied up by him. Then, when he had you tamed and bound, he would set
you free for a ransom —whatever price seemed appropriate to the two
of you.
But perhaps you’ll ask, what argument would Protagoras himself bring
to the help of his offspring. Shall we try to state it?
THEAETETUS : Yes, surely.
SOCRATES : Well, he will say all the things that we are saying in our
attempt to defend him; and then, I imagine, he will come to grips with 166
us, and in no respectful spirit either. I imagine him saying: ‘This good
Socrates here —what he did was to frighten a small boy by asking him if
it were possible that the same man should at once remember and not know
the same thing; and when the boy in his fright answered “No,” because
he couldn’t see what was coming, then, according to Socrates, the laugh
was against mein the argument. You are too easy-going, Socrates. The
true position is this. When you are examining any doctrine of mine by the
method of question and answer, if the person being questioned answers
as I myself would answer, and gets caught, then it is I who am refuted;Theaetetus 185
but if his answers are other than I should give, then it is he who is put in b
the wrong.
‘Now, to begin with, do you expect someone to grant you that a man
has a present memory of things he experienced in the past, this being an
experience rather like the original one, unless he is still experiencing them?
That is very far from being true. Again, do you suppose he will hesitate
to admit that it is possible for the same man to know and not know the
same thing? Or—if he has misgivings about this—do you expect him to
concede to you that the man, who is in process of becoming unlike, is the
same as he was before the process began? Do you expect him even to
speak of “the man” rather than of “the men,” indeed of an inﬁnite number
of these men coming to be in succession, assuming this process of becoming
unlike? Not if we really must take every precaution against each other’s c
verbal traps. Show a little more spirit, my good man,’ he will say, ‘and
attack my actual statement itself, and refute it, if you can, by showing that
each man’s perceptions are not his own private events; or that, if they are
his own private events, it does not follow that the thing which appears
“becomes” or, if we may speak of being, “is” only for the man to whom
it appears. You keep talking about pigs and baboons; you show the mental-
ity of a pig yourself, in the way you deal with my writings, and you
persuade your audience to follow your example. That is not the way d
to behave.
‘I take my stand on the truth being as I have written it. Each one of us
is the measure both of what is and of what is not; but there are countless
differences between men for just this very reason, that different things
both are and appear to be to different subjects. I certainly do not deny the
existence of both wisdom and wise men: far from it. But the man whom
I call wise is the man who can change the appearances—the man who in
any case where bad things both appear and are for one of us, works a
change and makes good things appear and be for him.
‘And I must beg you, this time, not to conﬁne your attack to the letter e
of my doctrine. I am now going to make its meaning clearer to you. For
instance, I would remind you of what we were saying before, namely,
that to the sick man the things he eats both appear and are bitter, while
to the healthy man they both appear and are the opposite. Now what we
have to do is not to make one of these two wiser than the other—that is 167
not even a possibility—nor is it our business to make accusations, calling
the sick man ignorant for judging as he does, and the healthy man wise,
because he judges differently. What we have to do is to make a change
from the one to the other, because the other state is better. In education,
too, what we have to do is to change a worse state into a better state; only
whereas the doctor brings about the change by the use of drugs, the
professional teacher16does it by the use of words. What never happens is
that a man who judges what is false is made to judge what is true. For it
16. Literally, ‘the sophist’.186 Theaetetus
is impossible to judge what is not, or to judge anything other than what one
is immediately experiencing; and what one is immediately experiencing is b
always true. This, in my opinion, is what really happens: when a man’s
soul is in a pernicious state, he judges things akin to it, but giving him a
sound state of the soul causes him to think different things, things that
are good. In the latter event, the things which appear to him are what
some people, who are still at a primitive stage, call “true”; my position,
however, is that the one kind are better than the others, but in no way truer.
‘Nor, my dear Socrates, should I dream of suggesting that we might
look for wisdom among frogs. I look for wisdom, as regards animal bodies,
in doctors; as regards plant-life, in gardeners —for I am quite prepared to
maintain that gardeners too, when they ﬁnd a plant sickly, proceed by c
causing it to have good and healthy, that is, “true” perceptions, instead
of bad ones. Similarly, the wise and efﬁcient politician is the man who
makes wholesome things seem just to a city instead of pernicious ones.
Whatever in any city is regarded as just and admirable isjust and admirable,
in that city and for so long as that convention maintains itself; but the
wise man replaces each pernicious convention by a wholesome one, making
this both be and seem just. Similarly the professional teacher who is able
to educate his pupils on these lines is a wise man, and is worth his large d
fees to them.
‘In this way we are enabled to hold both that some men are wiser than
others, and also that no man judges what is false. And you, too, whether
you like it or not, must put up with being a “measure.” For this is the line
we must take if we are to save the theory.
‘If you feel prepared to go back to the beginning, and make a case against
this theory, let us hear your objections set out in a connected argument.
Or, if you prefer the method of question and answer, do it that way; there
is no reason to try to evade that method either, indeed an intelligent person
might well prefer it to any other. Only I beg that you will observe this
condition: do not be unjust in your questions. It is the height of unreason- e
ableness that a person who professes to care for moral goodness should
be consistently unjust in discussion. I mean by injustice, in this connection,
the behavior of a man who does not take care to keep controversy distinct
from discussion; a man who forgets that in controversy he may play about
and trip up his opponent as often as he can, but that in discussion he must
be serious, he must keep on helping his opponent to his feet again, and
point out to him only those of his slips which are due to himself or to the 168
intellectual society which he has previously frequented. If you observe
this distinction, those who associate with you will blame themselves for
their confusion and their difﬁculties, not you. They will seek your company,
and think of you as their friend; but they will loathe themselves, and seek
refuge from themselves in philosophy, in the hope that they may thereby
become different people and be rid forever of the men that they once were.
But if you follow the common practice and do the opposite, you willTheaetetus 187
get the opposite results. Instead of philosophers, you will make your b
companions grow up to be the enemies of philosophy.
‘So, if you take my advice, as I said before, you will sit down with us
without ill will or hostility, in a kindly spirit. You will genuinely try to
ﬁnd out what our meaning is when we maintain (a) that all things are in
motion and (b) that for each person and each city, things are what they seem
to them to be. And upon this basis you will inquire whether knowledge and
perception are the same thing or different things. But you will not proceed
as you did just now. You will not base your argument upon the use and
wont of language; you will not follow the practice of most men, who drag c
words this way and that at their pleasure, so making every imaginable
difﬁculty for one another.’
Well, Theodorus, here is my contribution to the rescue of your friend —
the best I can do, with my resources, and little enough that is. If he were
alive himself, he would have come to the rescue of his offspring in a
grander style.
THEODORUS : That must be a joke, Socrates. It was a very spirited rescue.
SOCRATES : You are kind, my friend. Tell me now, did you notice that
Protagoras was complaining of us, in the speech that we have just heard, d
for addressing our arguments to a small boy and making the child’s ner-
vousness a weapon against his ideas? And how he disparaged our method
of arguments as merely an amusing game, and how solemnly he upheld
his‘measure of all things’ and commanded us to be serious when we dealt
with his theory?
THEODORUS : Yes, of course I noticed that, Socrates.
SOCRATES : Then do you think we should obey his commands?
THEODORUS : Most certainly I do.
SOCRATES : Look at the company then. They are all children but you. So
if we are to obey Protagoras, it is you and I who have got to be serious e
about his theory. It is you and I who must question and answer one
another. Then he will not have thisagainst us, at any rate, that we turned
the criticism of his philosophy into sport with boys.
THEODORUS : Well, isn’t our Theaetetus better able to follow the investiga-
tion of a theory than many an old fellow with a long beard?
SOCRATES : But not better than you, Theodorus. Do not go on imagining
that it is my business to be straining every nerve to defend your dead 169
friend while you do nothing. Come now, my very good Theodorus, come
a little way with me. Come with me at any rate until we see whether in
questions of geometrical proofs it is really you who should be the measure
or whether all men are as sufﬁcient to themselves as you are in astronomy
and all the other sciences in which you have made your name.
THEODORUS : Socrates, it is not easy for a man who has sat down beside
you to refuse to talk. That was all nonsense just now when I was pretending
that you were going to allow me to keep my coat on, and not use compul-
sion like the Spartans. So far from that, you seem to me to have leanings188 Theaetetus
towards the methods of Sciron.17The Spartans tell one either to strip or b
to go away; but you seem rather to be playing the part of Antaeus.18You
don’t let any comer go till you have stripped him and made him wrestle
with you in an argument.
SOCRATES : That, Theodorus, is an excellent simile to describe what is the
matter with me. But I am more of a ﬁend for exercise than Sciron and
Antaeus. I have met with many and many a Heracles and Theseus in my
time, mighty men of words; and they have well battered me. But for all
that I don’t retire from the ﬁeld, so terrible a lust has come upon me for c
these exercises. You must not grudge me this, either; try a fall with me
and we shall both be the better.
THEODORUS : All right. I resign myself; take me with you where you like.
In any case, I see, I have got to put up with the fate you spin for me, and
submit to your inquisition. But not further than the limits you have laid
down; beyond that I shall not be able to offer myself.
SOCRATES : It will do if you will go with me so far. Now there is one kind
of mistake I want you to be specially on your guard against, namely, that
we do not unconsciously slip into some childish form of argument. We d
don’t want to get into disgrace for this again.
THEODORUS : I will do my best, I promise you.
SOCRATES : The ﬁrst thing, then, is to tackle the same point that we were
dealing with before. We were making a complaint. Now let us see whether
we were right or wrong in holding it to be a defect in this theory that it
made every man self-sufﬁcient in wisdom; and whether we were right or
wrong when we made Protagoras concede that some men are superior
to others in questions of better and worse, these being ‘the wise’.D o
you agree?
THEODORUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : It would be a different matter if Protagoras were here in person
and agreed with us, instead of our having made this concession on his e
behalf in our attempt to help him. In that case, there would be no need
to take this question up again and make sure about it. In the circumstances,
however, it might be decided that we had no authority on his behalf, and
so it is desirable that we should come to a clearer agreement on this point;
for it makes no small difference whether this is so or not.
THEODORUS : True.
SOCRATES : Then don’t let us obtain this concession through anybody else. 170
Let us take the shortest way, an appeal to his own statement.
THEODORUS : How?
17. A legendary highwayman who attacked travellers on the coast between Megara and
Corinth. His most famous ‘method’ was to compel them to wash his feet, and kick them
over the cliff into the sea while they were so doing.
18. Antaeus was said to have lived in a cave and compelled all passers-by to wrestle
with him, with results invariably fatal to them.Theaetetus 189
SOCRATES : In this way. He says, does he not, that things are for every
man what they seem to him to be?
THEODORUS : Yes, that is what he says.
SOCRATES : Well, then, Protagoras, we too are expressing the judgments
of a man —I might say, of all men —when we say that there is no one in
the world who doesn’t believe that in some matters he is wiser than other
men; while in other matters, they are wiser than he. In emergencies —if at
no other time —you see this belief. When they are in distress, on the
battleﬁeld, or in sickness or in a storm at sea, all men turn to their leaders
in each sphere as to gods and look to them for salvation because they are b
superior in precisely this one thing —knowledge. And wherever human
life and work goes on, you ﬁnd everywhere men seeking teachers and
masters, for themselves and for other living creatures and for the direction
of all human works. You ﬁnd also men who believe that they are able to
teach and to take the lead. In all these cases, what else can we say but
that men do believe in the existence of both wisdom and ignorance
among themselves?
THEODORUS : There can be no other conclusion.
SOCRATES : And they believe that wisdom is true thinking? While igno-
rance is a matter of false judgment?
THEODORUS : Yes, of course. c
SOCRATES : What then, Protagoras, are we to make of your argument?
Are we to say that all men, on every occasion, judge what is true? Or that
they judge sometimes truly and sometimes falsely? Whichever we say, it
comes to the same thing, namely, that men do not always judge what is
true; that human judgments are both true and false. For think, Theodorus.
Would you, would anyone of the school of Protagoras be prepared to
contend that no one ever thinks his neighbor is ignorant or judging falsely?
THEODORUS : No, that’s not a thing one could believe, Socrates.
SOCRATES : And yet it is to this that our theory has been driven —this d
theory that man is the measure of all things.
THEODORUS : How is that?
SOCRATES : Well, suppose you come to a decision in your own mind and
then express a judgment about something to me. Let us assume with
Protagoras that your judgment is true for you. But isn’t it possible that the
rest of us may criticize your verdict? Do we always agree that your judg-
ment is true? Or does there rise up against you, every time, a vast army
of persons who think the opposite, who hold that your decisions and your
thoughts are false?
THEODORUS : Heaven knows they do, Socrates, in their ‘thousands and e
tens of thousands’, as Homer says,19and give me all the trouble that is
humanly possible.
19.Odyssey xvi.121.190 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : Then do you want us to say that you are then judging what
is true for yourself, but false for the tens of thousands?
THEODORUS : It looks as if that is what we must say, according to the
theory, at any rate.
SOCRATES : And what of Protagoras himself? Must he not say this, that
supposing he himself did not believe that man is the measure, any more
than the majority of people (who indeed do not believe it), then this Truth
which he wrote is true for no one? On the other hand, suppose he believed 171
it himself, but the majority of men do not agree with him; then you see —
to begin with —the more those to whom it does not seem to be the truth
outnumber those to whom it does, so much the more it isn’t than it is?
THEODORUS : That must be so, if it is going to be or not be according to
the individual judgment.
SOCRATES : Secondly, it has this most exquisite feature: Protagoras admits,
I presume, that the contrary opinion about his own opinion (namely, that
it is false) must be true, seeing he agrees that all men judge what is.
THEODORUS : Undoubtedly.
SOCRATES : And in conceding the truth of the opinion of those who think b
him wrong, he is really admitting the falsity of his own opinion?
THEODORUS : Yes, inevitably.
SOCRATES : But for their part the others do not admit that they are wrong?
THEODORUS : No.
SOCRATES : But Protagoras again admits thisjudgment to be true, accord-
ing to his written doctrine?
THEODORUS : So it appears.
SOCRATES : It will be disputed, then, by everyone, beginning with Protag-
oras —or rather, it will be admitted by him, when he grants to the person
who contradicts him that he judges truly —when he does that, even Protag- c
oras himself will be granting that neither a dog nor the ‘man in the street’
is the measure of anything at all which he has not learned. Isn’t that so?
THEODORUS :I ti ss o .
SOCRATES : Then since it is disputed by everyone, the Truth of Protagoras
is not true for anyone at all, not even for himself?
THEODORUS : Socrates, we are running my friend too hard.
SOCRATES : But it is not at all clear, my dear Theodorus, that we are
running off the right track. Hence it is likely that Protagoras, being older
than we are, really is wiser as well; and if he were to stick up his head d
from below as far as the neck just here where we are, he would in all
likelihood convict me twenty times over of talking nonsense, and show
you up too for agreeing with me, before he ducked down to rush off again.
But we have got to take ourselves as we are, I suppose, and go on saying
the things which seem to us to be. At the moment, then, mustn’tw e
maintain that any man would admit at least this, that some men are wiser
than their fellows and others more ignorant?
THEODORUS : So it seems to me, at any rate.Theaetetus 191
SOCRATES : We may also suggest that the theory would stand ﬁrm most
successfully in the position which we sketched out for it in our attempt e
to bring help to Protagoras. I mean the position that most things are for
the individual what they seem to him to be; for instance, warm, dry, sweet
and all this type of thing. But if the theory is going to admit that there is
any sphere in which one man is superior to another, it might perhaps be
prepared to grant it in questions of what is good or bad for one’s health.
Here it might well be admitted that it is not true that every creature—
woman or child or even animal—is competent to recognize what is good
for it and to heal its own sickness; that here, if anywhere, one person is
better than another. Do you agree?
THEODORUS : Yes, that seems so to me.
SOCRATES : Then consider political questions. Some of these are questions 172
of what may or may not ﬁttingly be done, of just and unjust, of pious and
impious; and here the theory may be prepared to maintain that whatever
view a city takes on these matters and establishes as its law or convention,
is truth and fact for that city. In such matters neither any individual nor
any city can claim superior wisdom. But when it is a question of laying
down what is to the interest of the state and what is not, the matter is
different. The theory will again admit that here, if anywhere, one counsellor
is better than another; here the decision of one city may be more in confor-
mity with the truth than that of another. It would certainly not have the b
hardihood to afﬁrm that when a city decides that a certain thing is to its
own interest, that thing will undoubtedly turn out to be to its interest. It
is in those other questions I am talking about—just and unjust, pious and
impious—that men are ready to insist that no one of these things has by
nature any being of its own; in respect of these, they say, what seems to
people collectively to be so is true, at the time when it seems that way
and for just as long as it so seems. And even those who are not prepared
to go all the way with Protagoras take some such view of wisdom. But I
see, Theodorus, that we are becoming involved in a greater discussion c
emerging from the lesser one.
THEODORUS : Well, we have plenty of time, haven’t we, Socrates?
SOCRATES : We appear to . . . That remark of yours, my friend, reminds
me of an idea that has often occurred to me before—how natural it is that
men who have spent a great part of their lives in philosophical studies make
such fools of themselves when they appear as speakers in the law courts.
THEODORUS : How do you mean now?
SOCRATES : Well, look at the man who has been knocking about in law
courts and such places ever since he was a boy; and compare him with
the man brought up in philosophy, in the life of a student. It is surely like d
comparing the upbringing of a slave with that of a free man.
THEODORUS : How is that, now?
SOCRATES : Because the one man always has what you mentioned just
now—plenty of time. When he talks, he talks in peace and quiet, and his192 Theaetetus
time is his own. It is so with us now: here we are beginning on our third
new discussion; and he can do the same, if he is like us, and prefers the
newcomer to the question in hand. It does not matter to such men whether
they talk for a day or a year, if only they may hit upon that which is. But
the other —the man of the law courts —is always in a hurry when he is e
talking; he has to speak with one eye on the clock. Besides, he can’t make
his speeches on any subject he likes; he has his adversary standing over
him, armed with compulsory powers and with the sworn statement, which
is read out point by point as he proceeds, and must be kept to by the
speaker. The talk is always about a fellow-slave, and is addressed to a
master, who sits there holding some suit or other in his hand. And the
struggle is never a matter of indifference; it always directly concerns the
speaker, and sometimes life itself is at stake.
Such conditions make him keen and highly strung, skilled in ﬂattering 173
the master and working his way into favor; but cause his soul to be small
and warped. His early servitude prevents him from making a free, straight
growth; it forces him into doing crooked things by imposing dangers and
alarms upon a soul that is still tender. He cannot meet these by just and
honest practice, and so resorts to lies and to the policy of repaying one
wrong with another; thus he is constantly being bent and distorted, and b
in the end grows up to manhood with a mind that has no health in it,
having now become —in his own eyes —a man of ability and wisdom.
There is your practical man, Theodorus. What about our own set? Would
you like us to have a review of them, or shall we let them be, and return
to the argument? We don’t want to abuse this freedom to change our
subject of which we were speaking just now.
THEODORUS : No, no, Socrates. Let us review the philosophers. What you c
said just now was quite right; we who move in such circles are not the
servants but the masters of our discussions. Our arguments are our own,
like slaves; each one must wait about for us, to be ﬁnished whenever we
think ﬁt. We have no jury, and no audience (as the dramatic poets have),
sitting in control over us, ready to criticize and give orders.
SOCRATES : Very well, then; we must review them, it seems, since you
have made up your mind. But let us conﬁne ourselves to the leaders;
why bother about the second-rate specimens? To begin with, then, the
philosopher grows up without knowing the way to the market-place, or d
the whereabouts of the law courts or the council chambers or any other
place of public assembly. Laws and decrees, published orally or in writing,
are things he never sees or hears. The scrambling of political cliques for
ofﬁce; social functions, dinners, parties with ﬂute-girls —such doings never
enter his head even in a dream. So with questions of birth —he has no
more idea whether a fellow citizen is high-born or humble, or whether he
has inherited some taint from his forebears, male or female, than he has
of the number of pints in the sea, as they say. And in all these matters, e
he knows not even that he knows not; for he does not hold himself aloof
from them in order to get a reputation, but because it is in reality only hisTheaetetus 193
body that lives and sleeps in the city. His mind, having come to the
conclusion that all these things are of little or no account, spurns them
and pursues its winge ´d way, as Pindar says,20throughout the universe,
‘in the deeps beneath the earth’ and geometrizing its surfaces, ‘in the
heights above the heaven’, astronomizing, and tracking down by every
path the entire nature of each whole among the things that are, never 174
condescending to what lies near at hand.
THEODORUS : What do you mean by that, Socrates?
SOCRATES : Well, here’s an instance: they say Thales21was studying the
stars, Theodorus, and gazing aloft, when he fell into a well; and a witty
and amusing Thracian servant-girl made fun of him because, she said, he
was wild to know about what was up in the sky but failed to see what
was in front of him and under his feet. The same joke applies to all who
spend their lives in philosophy. It really is true that the philosopher fails b
to see his next-door neighbor; he not only doesn’t notice what he is doing;
he scarcely knows whether he is a man or some other kind of creature.
The question he asks is, What is Man? What actions and passions properly
belong to human nature and distinguish it from all other beings? This is
what he wants to know and concerns himself to investigate. You see what
I mean, Theodorus, don’t you?
THEODORUS : Yes, and what you say is true.
SOCRATES : This accounts, my friend, for the behavior of such a man when
he comes into contact with his fellows, either privately with individuals c
or in public life, as I was saying at the beginning. Whenever he is obliged,
in a law court or elsewhere, to discuss the things that lie at his feet and
before his eyes, he causes entertainment not only to Thracian servant-girls
but to all the common herd, by tumbling into wells and every sort of
difﬁculty through his lack of experience. His clumsiness is awful and gets
him a reputation for fatuousness. On occasions when personal scandal is
the topic of conversation, he never has anything at all of his own to
contribute; he knows nothing to the detriment of anyone, never having
paid any attention to this subject—a lack of resource which makes him d
look very comic. And again, when compliments are in order, and self-
laudation, his evident amusement—which is by no means a pose but
perfectly genuine—is regarded as idiotic. When he hears the praises of a
despot or a king being sung, it sounds to his ears as if some stock-breeder
were being congratulated—some keeper of pigs or sheep, or cows that are
giving him plenty of milk; only he thinks that the rulers have a more
difﬁcult and treacherous animal to rear and milk, and that such a man,
having no spare time, is bound to become quite as coarse and uncultivated e
as the stock-farmer; for the castle of the one is as much a prison as the
20. This quotation from a lost poem of Pindar’s is listed as his frag. 292 (Snell).
21. The ﬁrst founder of Greek natural philosophy (sixth century B.C.), about whom we
have anecdotes but little solid information.194 Theaetetus
mountain fold of the other. When he hears talk of land —that so-and-so
has a property of ten thousand acres or more, and what a vast property
that is, it sounds to him like a tiny plot, used as he is to envisage the
whole earth. When his companions become lyric on the subject of great
families, and exclaim at the noble blood of one who can point to seven
wealthy ancestors, he thinks that such praise comes of a dim and limited
vision, an inability, through lack of education, to take a steady view of 175
the whole, and to calculate that every single man has countless hosts of
ancestors, near and remote, among whom are to be found, in every instance,
rich men and beggars, kings and slaves, Greeks and foreigners, by the
thousand. When men pride themselves upon a pedigree of twenty- ﬁve
ancestors, and trace their descent back to Heracles the son of Amphitryon,
they seem to him to be taking a curious interest in tri ﬂes. As for the twenty- b
ﬁfth ancestor of Amphitryon, what hemay have been is merely a matter
of luck, and similarly with the ﬁftieth before him again. How ridiculous,
he thinks, not to be able to work that out, and get rid of the gaping vanity
of a silly mind.
On all these occasions, you see, the philosopher is the object of general
derision, partly for what men take to be his superior manner, and partly
for his constant ignorance and lack of resource in dealing with the obvious.
THEODORUS : What you say exactly describes what does happen, Socrates.
SOCRATES : But consider what happens, my friend, when he in his turn
draws someone to a higher level, and induces him to abandon questions
of‘My injustice towards you, or yours towards me’ for an examination of c
justice and injustice themselves —what they are, and how they differ from
everything else and from each other; or again, when he gets him to leave
such questions as ‘Whether a king who possesses much gold is happy? ’22
for an inquiry into kingship, and into human happiness and misery in
general —what these two things are, and what, for a human being, is the
proper method by which the one can be obtained and the other avoided.
When it is an account of matters like all these that is demanded of our d
friend with the small, sharp, legal mind, the situation is reversed; his head
swims as, suspended at such a height, he gazes down from his place among
the clouds; disconcerted by the unusual experience, he knows not what
to do next, and can only stammer when he speaks. And that causes great
entertainment, not to Thracian servant-girls or any other uneducated per-
sons —they do not see what is going on —but to all men who have not
been brought up like slaves.
These are the two types, Theodorus. There is the one who has been e
brought up in true freedom and leisure, the man you call a philosopher;
a man to whom it is no disgrace to appear simple and good-for-nothing
when he is confronted with menial tasks, when, for instance, he doesn ’t
know how to make a bed, or how to sweeten a sauce or a ﬂattering speech.
Then you have the other, the man who is keen and smart at doing all
22. Reading, with Madvig, tau¨chrusion.Theaetetus 195
these jobs, but does not know how to strike up a song in his turn like a
free man, or how to tune the strings of common speech to the ﬁtting praise 176
of the life of gods and of the happy among men.
THEODORUS : Socrates, if your words convinced everyone as they do me,
there would be more peace and less evil on earth.
SOCRATES : But it is not possible, Theodorus, that evil should be de-
stroyed —for there must always be something opposed to the good; nor
is it possible that it should have its seat in heaven. But it must inevitably
haunt human life, and prowl about this earth. That is why a man should
make all haste to escape from earth to heaven; and escape means becoming b
as like God as possible; and a man becomes like God when he becomes
just and pious, with understanding. But it is not at all an easy matter, my
good friend, to persuade men that it is not for the reasons commonly
alleged that one should try to escape from wickedness and pursue virtue.
It is not in order to avoid a bad reputation and obtain a good one that
virtue should be practiced and not vice; that, it seems to me, is only what c
men call ‘old wives’ talk’.
Let us try to put the truth in this way. In God there is no sort of wrong
whatsoever; he is supremely just, and the thing most like him is the man
who has become as just as it lies in human nature to be. And it is here
that we see whether a man is truly able, or truly a weakling and a nonentity;
for it is the realization of this that is genuine wisdom and goodness, while
the failure to realize it is manifest folly and wickedness. Everything else
that passes for ability and wisdom has a sort of commonness —in those
who wield political power a poor cheap show, in the manual workers a
matter of mechanical routine. If, therefore, one meets a man who practices d
injustice and is blasphemous in his talk or in his life, the best thing for
him by far is that one should never grant that there is any sort of ability
about his unscrupulousness; such men are ready enough to glory in the
reproach, and think that it means not that they are mere rubbish, cumbering
the ground to no purpose, but that they have the kind of qualities that
are necessary for survival in the community. We must therefore tell them
the truth —that their very ignorance of their true state ﬁxes them the more
ﬁrmly therein. For they do not know what is the penalty of injustice, which
is the last thing of which a man should be ignorant. It is not what they
suppose —scourging and death —things which they may entirely evade in
spite of their wrongdoing. It is a penalty from which there is no escape. e
THEODORUS : And what is that?
SOCRATES : My friend, there are two patterns set up in reality. One is
divine and supremely happy; the other has nothing of God in it, and is
the pattern of the deepest unhappiness. This truth the evildoer does not
see; blinded by folly and utter lack of understanding, he fails to perceive 177
that the effect of his unjust practices is to make him grow more and more
like the one, and less and less like the other. For this he pays the penalty
of living the life that corresponds to the pattern he is coming to resemble.
And if we tell him that, unless he is delivered from this ‘ability’ of his,196 Theaetetus
when he dies the place that is pure of all evil will not receive him; that
he will forever go on living in this world a life after his own likeness —a
bad man tied to bad company: he will but think, ‘This is the way fools
talk to a clever rascal like me.’
THEODORUS : Oh, yes, Socrates, sure enough.
SOCRATES : I know it, my friend. But there is one accident to which the b
unjust man is liable. When it comes to giving and taking an account in a
private discussion of the things he disparages; when he is willing to stand
his ground like a man for long enough, instead of running away like a
coward, then, my friend, an odd thing happens. In the end the things he
says do not satisfy even himself; that famous eloquence of his somehow
dries up, and he is left looking nothing more than a child.
But we had better leave it there; all this is really a digression; and if we c
go on, a ﬂood of new subjects will pour in and overwhelm our original
argument. So, if you don’t mind, we will go back to what we were say-
ing before.
THEODORUS : As a matter of fact, Socrates, Ilike listening to this kind of
talk; it is easier for a man of my years to follow. Still, if you like, let us
go back to the argument.
SOCRATES : Well, then, we were at somewhere about this point in the
argument, weren’t we? We were speaking of the people who assert a being
that is in motion, and who hold that for every individual things always
are whatever they seem to him to be; and we said that they were prepared
to stand upon their principle in almost every case —not least in questions
of what is just and right. Here they are perfectly ready to maintain that
whatever any community decides to be just and right, and establishes as d
such, actually is what is just and right for that community and for as long
as it remains so established. On the other hand, when it is a question of
what things are good, we no longer ﬁnd anyone so heroic that he will
venture to contend that whatever a community thinks useful, and estab-
lishes, really is useful, so long as it is the established order —unless, of
course, he means that it is called ‘useful’; but that would be making a game
of our argument, wouldn’t it?
THEODORUS : It would indeed.
SOCRATES : Let us suppose, then, that he is not talking about the name e
‘useful’ but has in view the thing to which it is applied.
THEODORUS : Agreed.
SOCRATES : It is surely this that a government aims at when it legislates,
whatever name it calls it. A community always makes such laws as are
most useful to it —so far as the limits of its judgment and capacity permit. —
Or do you think legislation may have some other object in view?
THEODORUS : Oh no, not at all. 178
SOCRATES : And does a community always achieve this object? Or are
there always a number of failures?
THEODORUS : It seems to me that there are failures.Theaetetus 197
SOCRATES : Now we might put this matter in a rather different way
and be still more likely to get people generally to agree with our
conclusions. I mean, one might put a question about the whole class
of things to which ‘what is useful’ belongs. These things are concerned,
I take it, with future time; thus when we legislate, we make laws that
are going to be useful in the time to come. This kind of thing we may
properly call ‘future’.
THEODORUS : Yes, certainly. b
SOCRATES : Come then, let’s put a question to Protagoras (or to anyone
who professes the same views): ‘Now, Protagoras, “Man is the measure
of all things” as you people say —of white and heavy and light and all
that kind of thing without exception. He has the criterion of these things
within himself; so when he thinks that they are as he experiences them,
he thinks what is true and what really is for him.’ Isn’t that so?
THEODORUS :I ti s .
SOCRATES :‘Then, Protagoras,’ we shall say, ‘what about things that are
going to be in the future? Has a man the criterion of these within himself? c
When he thinks certain things will be, do they actually happen, for him,
as he thought they would? Take heat, for example. Suppose the ordinary
man thinks he is going to take a fever, and that his temperature will go
up to fever point; while another man, this time a doctor, thinks the opposite.
Do we hold that the future will conﬁrm either the one judgment or the
other? Or are we to say that it will conﬁrm both; that is, that for the doctor
the man will not have a temperature or be suffering from fever, while for
himself he will?’
THEODORUS : That would be absurd.
SOCRATES : But, when there is a question of the sweetness and dryness
of the next vintage, I presume it would always be the grower ’s judgment d
that would carry authority, rather than that of a musician?
THEODORUS : Of course.
SOCRATES : Nor again, in any question of what will be in tune or out of
tune, would the judgment of a teacher of gymnastic be superior to that of
a musician —even about what is going to seem to be in tune to the gymnastic
master himself?
THEODORUS : No, never.
SOCRATES : Or suppose a dinner is being prepared. Even the guest who
is going to eat it, if he has no knowledge of cooking, will not be able to
pronounce so authoritative a verdict as the professional cook on how nice
it is going to be. I say ‘going to be’, because we had better not at this stage e
press our point as regards what is now pleasant to any individual, or what
has been in the past. Our question for the moment is, whether the individual
himself is the best judge, for himself, of what is going to seem and be for
him in the future. ‘Or,’ we will ask, ‘would not you, Protagoras, predict
better than any layman about the persuasive effect that speeches in a law
court will have upon any one of us?’198 Theaetetus
THEODORUS : And in fact, Socrates, this at any rate is a point on which
Protagoras used to make strong claims to superiority over other people.
SOCRATES : Of course he did, my dear good fellow. No one would have
paid large fees for the privilege of talking with him if he had not been in 179
the habit of persuading his pupils that he was a better judge than any
fortune-teller—or anyone else—about what was going to be and seem to
be in the future.23
THEODORUS : That’s true enough.
SOCRATES : Legislation also and ‘what is useful’ is concerned with the
future; and it would be generally admitted to be inevitable that a city
when it legislates often fails to achieve what is the most useful.
THEODORUS : Yes, surely.
SOCRATES : Then we shall be giving your master fair measure if we tell
him that he has now got to admit that one man is wiser than another, and b
that it is such a man who is ‘the measure’; but that I, the man with no
special knowledge, have not by any means got to be a measure—a part
which the recent speech in his defense was trying to force upon me, whether
I liked it or not.
THEODORUS : Now that, Socrates, seems to me to be the chief point on
which the theory is convicted of error—though it stands convicted also
when it makes other men’s judgments carry authority and these turn out
to involve thinking that Protagoras’ statements are completely untrue.
SOCRATES : There is more than one point besides these, Theodorus, on c
which a conviction might be secured—at least so far as it is a matter of
proving that not every man’s judgment is true. But so long as we keep
within the limits of that immediate present experience of the individual
which gives rise to perceptions and to perceptual judgments, it is more
difﬁcult to convict these latter of being untrue—but perhaps I’m talking
nonsense. Perhaps it is not possible to convict them at all; perhaps those
who profess that they are perfectly evident and are always knowledge
may be saying what really is. And it may be that our Theaetetus was not
far from the mark with his proposition that knowledge and perception d
are the same thing. We shall have to come to closer grips with the theory,
as the speech on behalf of Protagoras required us to do. We shall have to
consider and test this moving Being, and ﬁnd whether it rings true or
sounds as if it had some ﬂaw in it. There is no small ﬁght going on about
it, anyway—and no shortage of ﬁghting men.
THEODORUS : No, indeed; but in Ionia it seems to be even growing, and
assuming vast dimensions. On the side of this theory, the Heraclitean party
is conducting a most vigorous campaign.
23. An alternative text (accepting the conjecture of de¯forme¯at 179a1 and retaining the
mss’ hauto ¯iat a3) yields: ‘if he really was in the habit of persuading his pupils that, even
about the future, neither a fortune-teller nor anyone else can judge better than one can
for oneself’.Theaetetus 199
SOCRATES : The more reason, then, my dear Theodorus, why we should
examine it by going back to its ﬁrst principle,24which is the way they e
present it themselves.
THEODORUS : I quite agree. You know, Socrates, these Heraclitean doc-
trines (or, as you say, Homeric or still more ancient) —you can’t discuss
them in person with any of the people at Ephesus who profess to be adepts,
any more than you could with a maniac. They are just like the things they
say in their books —always on the move. As for abiding by what is said,
or sticking to a question, or quietly answering and asking questions in turn, 180
there is less than nothing of that in their capacity. That ’s an exaggeration, no
doubt. I mean there isn’t so much as a tiny bit of repose in these people.
If you ask any one of them a question, he will pull out some little enigmatic
phrase from his quiver and shoot it off at you; and if you try to make him
give an account of what he has said, you will only get hit by another, full
of strange turns of language. You will never reach any conclusion with
any of them, ever; indeed they never reach any conclusion with each other,
they are so very careful not to allow anything to be stable, either in an b
argument or in their own souls. I suppose they think that if they did it
would be something that stands still —this being what they are totally at
war with, and what they are determined to banish from the universe, if
they can.
SOCRATES : I dare say, Theodorus, you have seen these men only on the
ﬁeld of battle, and never been with them in times of peace —as you don’t
belong to their set. I expect they keep such matters to be explained at
leisure to their pupils whom they want to make like themselves.
THEODORUS :Pupils, my good man? There are no pupils and teachers
among these people. They just spring up on their own, one here, one there, c
wherever they happen to catch their inspiration; and no one of them will
credit another with knowing anything. As I was just going to say, you
will never get these men to give an account of themselves, willingly or
unwillingly. What we must do is to take their doctrine out of their hands
and consider it for ourselves, as we should a problem in geometry.
SOCRATES : What you say is very reasonable. This problem now, we have
inherited it, have we not, from the ancients? They used poetical forms d
which concealed from the majority of men their real meaning, namely,
that Ocean and Tethys, the origin of all things, are actually ﬂowing streams,
and nothing stands still. In more modern times, the problem is presented
to us by men who, being more accomplished in these matters, plainly
demonstrate their meaning so that even shoemakers may hear and assimi-
late their wisdom, and give up the silly idea that some things in this world
stand still while others move, learn that all things are in motion, and
recognize the greatness of their instructors.
24. I.e., the principle that everything is really motion (156a).200 Theaetetus
But I was almost forgetting, Theodorus, that there are other thinkers
who have announced the opposite view; who tell us that ’Unmoved is the e
Universe’,25and other similar statements which we hear from a Melissus26
or a Parmenides as against the whole party of Heracliteans. These philoso-
phers insist that all things are One, and that this One stands still, itself
within itself, having no place in which to move.
What are we to do with all these people, my friend? We have been
gradually advancing till, without realizing it, we have got ourselves in
between the two parties; and if we don ’t in some way manage to put up 181
aﬁght and make our escape, we shall pay for it, like the people who play
that game on the line in the wrestling schools, and get caught by both
parties and pulled in opposite directions.
Now I think we ought to begin by examining the other party, the ﬂuent
fellows we started to pursue. If they appear to us to be talking sense, we
will help them to drag us over to their side, and try to escape the others.
But if those who make their stand for the whole appear to be nearer the
truth, we will take refuge with them from the men who ‘move what should b
not be moved’. And if it appears that neither party has a reasonable theory,
then we shall be very absurd if we think that insigni ﬁcant people like
ourselves can have anything to say, after we have rejected the views of men
who lived so long ago and possessed all wisdom. Think now, Theodorus, is
it of any use for us to go forward upon such a dangerous venture?
THEODORUS : We can’t refuse to examine the doctrines of these two schools,
Socrates; that couldn’t be allowed.
SOCRATES : Then we must examine them, if youfeel so strongly about it. c
Now it seems to me that the proper starting point of our criticism is the
nature of motion; what is this thing that they are talking about when they
say that all things are in motion? I mean, for example, are they referring
to one form of motion only, or, as I think, to two —but don’t let this be
only what Ithink. You commit yourself as well, so that we may come to
grief together, if need be. Tell me, do you call it ‘motion’ when a thing
changes from one place to another or turns round in the same place?
THEODORUS : I do, yes.
SOCRATES : Here then is one form of motion. Then supposing a thing
remains in the same place, but grows old, or becomes black instead of d
white, or hard instead of soft, or undergoes any other alteration; isn ’ti t
right to say that here we have motion in another form?
THEODORUS : Unquestionably.
SOCRATES : Then I now have two forms of motion, alteration and spa-
tial movement.
THEODORUS : Yes; and that’s quite correct.
SOCRATES : Then now that we have made this distinction, let us have a
talk with the people who allege that all things are in motion. Let us ask
25. Both the text and the sense of this quotation are uncertain.
26. Melissus of Samos was a ﬁfth-century follower of Parmenides.Theaetetus 201
them, ‘Do you hold that everything is in motion in both ways, that is, that e
it both moves through space and undergoes alteration? Or do you suggest
that some things are in motion in both ways, and some only in one or
the other?’
THEODORUS : Heaven knows, Ican’t answer that. I suppose they would
say, in both ways.
SOCRATES : Yes; otherwise, my friend, it will turn out that, in their view,
things are both moving and standing still; and it will be no more correct
to say that all things are in motion than to say that all things stand still.
THEODORUS : That’s perfectly true.
SOCRATES : Then since they must be in motion, and there is no such thing
anywhere as absence of motion, it follows that all things are always in 182
every kind of motion.
THEODORUS : Yes, that must be so.
SOCRATES : Then I want you to consider this point in their theory. As we
were saying, they hold that the genesis of things such as warmth and
whiteness occurs when each of them is moving, together with a perception,
in the space between the active and passive factors: the passive factor
thereby becoming percipient, but not a perception, while the active factor
becomes such or such, but not a quality —isn’t that so? But perhaps ‘quality’
seems a strange word to you; perhaps you don ’t quite understand it as a
general expression.27So I will talk about particular cases. What I mean is
that the active factor becomes not warmth or whiteness, but warm and b
white; and so on. You will remember, perhaps, that we said in the earlier
stages of the argument that there is nothing which in itself is just one
thing; and that this applies also to the active and passive factors. It is by
the association of the two with one another that they generate perceptions
and the things perceived; and in so doing, the active factor becomes such
and such, while the passive factor becomes percipient.
THEODORUS : Yes, I remember that, of course.
SOCRATES : Then we need not concern ourselves about other points in c
their doctrine, whether they mean what we say or something else. We
must keep our eyes simply upon the object of our discussion. We must
ask them this question: ‘According to you, all things move and ﬂow; isn’t
that so?’
THEODORUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : And they have both the motions that we distinguished, that
is to say, they both move and alter?
THEODORUS : That must be so, if they are to be wholly and completely
in motion.
SOCRATES : Now if they were only moving through space and not altering,
we should presumably be able to say what the moving things ﬂow? Or
how do we express it?
27. This is the ﬁrst occurrence in Greek of the word poiote ¯s,‘quality’ or‘what-sort-ness’,
coined by Plato from the interrogative adjective poios, ‘of what sort? ’.202 Theaetetus
THEODORUS : That’s all right.
SOCRATES : But since not even this abides, that what ﬂows ﬂows white, d
but rather it is in process of change, so that there is ﬂux of this very thing
also, the whiteness, and it is passing over into another color, lest it be
convicted of standing still in this respect —since that is so, is it possible to
give any name to a color which will properly apply to it?
THEODORUS : I don’t see how one could, Socrates; nor yet surely to any-
thing else of that kind, if, being in ﬂux, it is always quietly slipping away
as you speak?
SOCRATES : And what about any particular kind of perception; for exam-
ple, seeing or hearing? Does it ever abide, and remain seeing or hearing? e
THEODORUS : It ought not to, certainly, if all things are in motion.
SOCRATES : Then we may not call anything seeing rather than not-seeing;
nor indeed may we call it any other perception rather than not —if it be
admitted that all things are in motion in every way?
THEODORUS : No, we may not.
SOCRATES : Yet Theaetetus and I said that knowledge was perception?
THEODORUS : You did.
SOCRATES : And so our answer to the question, ‘What is knowledge?’
gave something which is no more knowledge than not.
THEODORUS : It seems as if it did. 183
SOCRATES :Aﬁne way this turns out to be of making our answer right.
We were most anxious to prove that all things are in motion, in order to
make that answer come out correct; but what has really emerged is that,
if all things are in motion, every answer, on whatever subject, is equally
correct, both ‘it is thus’ and ‘it is not thus’—or if you like ‘becomes’,a s
we don’t want to use any expressions which will bring our friends to
a standstill.
THEODORUS : You are quite right.
SOCRATES : Well, yes, Theodorus, except that I said ‘thus’ and ‘not thus’. b
One must not use even the word ‘thus’; for this ‘thus’ would no longer
be in motion; nor yet ‘not thus’ for here again there is no motion. The
exponents of this theory need to establish some other language; as it is,
they have no words that are consistent with their hypothesis —unless it
would perhaps suit them best to use ‘not at all thus’ in a quite indeﬁ-
nite sense.
THEODORUS : That would at least be an idiom most appropriate to them.
SOCRATES : Then we are set free from your friend, Theodorus. We do not c
yet concede to him that every man is the measure of all things, if he be
not a man of understanding. And we are not going to grant that knowledge
is perception, not at any rate on the line of inquiry which supposes that
all things are in motion; we are not going to grant it unless Theaetetus
here has some other way of stating it.
THEODORUS : That’s very good hearing, Socrates, for when these matters
were concluded I was to be set free from my task of answering you,Theaetetus 203
according to our agreement, which speciﬁed the end of the discussion of
Protagoras’ theory.
THEAETETUS : Oh, no, indeed, Theodorus! Not till you and Socrates have d
done what you proposed just now, and dealt with the other side, the
people who say that the Universe stands still.
THEODORUS : What’s this, Theaetetus? You at your age teaching your elders
to be unjust and break their agreements? What you have got to do is to pre-
pare to render account to Socrates yourself for the rest of the discussion.
THEAETETUS : All right, if he likes. But I would rather have listened to a
discussion of these views.
THEODORUS : Well, challenging Socrates to an argument is like inviting
‘cavalry into the plain’. So ask your questions and you shall hear.
SOCRATES : But I don’t think, Theodorus, that I am going to be persuaded
by Theaetetus to do what he demands. e
THEODORUS : But what is it makes you unwilling?
SOCRATES : Shame. I am afraid our criticism might be a very cheap affair.
And if I feel like this before the many who have made the universe one
and unmoved, Melissus and the rest of them, I feel it still more in the face
of the One—Parmenides. Parmenides seems to me, in the words of Homer,
to be ‘reverend’ and ‘awful’.28I met him when I was very young and he
was a very old man; and he seemed to me to have a wholly noble depth.29184
So I am afraid we might not understand even what he says; still less should
we attain to his real thought. Above all, I am afraid that the very object
of our discussion, the nature of knowledge, might be left unexamined
amid the crowd of theories that will rush in upon us if we admit them;
especially as the theory we have now brought up is one which involves
unmanageably vast issues. To treat it as a sideshow would be insult and
injury; while if it is adequately discussed, it is likely to spread out until
it completely eclipses the problems of knowledge. We must not do either.
What we must do is to make use of our midwife’s art to deliver Theaetetus b
of the thoughts which he has conceived about the nature of knowledge.*
THEODORUS : Well, if that is what you think proper, it must be done.
SOCRATES : Now, Theaetetus, I want you to think about one point in what
has been said. Your answer was that knowledge is perception, wasn’t it?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Now supposing you were asked: ‘With what does a man see
white and black things, and with what does he hear high and low notes?’
You would reply, I imagine, ‘With his eyes and ears.’
THEAETETUS : I should, yes.
28.Iliad iii.172.
29. A reference probablyto the discussion between Socrates andParmenides in Parmenides.
*Alternatively, this sentence could be translated: ‘What we must do is to make use of
our midwife’s art to set Theaetetus free from the thoughts which he has conceived about
the nature of knowledge’.204 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : Now as a rule it is no sign of ill-breeding to be easy in the c
use of language and take no particular care in one ’s choice of words; it is
rather the opposite that gives a man away. But such exactness is sometimes
necessary; and it is necessary here, for example, to fasten upon something
in your answer that is not correct. Think now. Is it more correct to say
that the eyes are that with which we see, or that through which we see?
Do we hear with the ears or through the ears?
THEAETETUS : Well, I should think, Socrates, that it is ‘through which’ we
perceive in each case, rather than ‘with which.’
SOCRATES : Yes, my son. It would be a very strange thing, I must say, if d
there were a number of perceptions sitting inside us as if we were Wooden
Horses, and there were not some single form, soul or whatever one ought
to call it, to which all these converge —something with which, through those
things,30as if they were instruments, we perceive all that is perceptible.
THEAETETUS : That sounds to me better than the other way of putting it.
SOCRATES : Now the reason why I am being so precise with you is this.
I want to know if it is with one and the same part of ourselves that we
reach, through our eyes to white and black things, and through the other e
means to yet further things; and whether, if asked, you will be able to
refer all these to the body. But perhaps it would be better if you stated
the answers yourself, rather than that I should busy myself on your behalf.
Tell me: the instruments through which you perceive hot, hard, light, sweet
things —do you consider that they all belong to the body? Or can they be
referred elsewhere?
THEAETETUS : No, they all belong to the body.
SOCRATES : And are you also willing to admit that what you perceive
through one power, you can’t perceive through another? For instance, 185
what you perceive through hearing, you couldn’t perceive through sight,
and similarly what you perceive through sight you couldn ’t perceive
through hearing?
THEAETETUS : I could hardly refuse to grant that.
SOCRATES : Then suppose you think something about both; you can ’t
possibly be having a perception about both, either through one of these
instruments or through the other?
THEAETETUS : No.
SOCRATES : Now take a sound and a color. First of all, don ’t you think
this same thing about both of them, namely, that they both are?
THEAETETUS : I do.
SOCRATES : Also that each of them is different from the other and the
same as itself?
THEAETETUS : Of course. b
SOCRATES : And that both together are two, and each of them is one?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I think that too.
30. Viz., the eyes and ears.Theaetetus 205
SOCRATES : Are you also able to consider whether they are like or unlike
each other?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I may be.
SOCRATES : Now what is it through which you think all these things about
them? It is not possible, you see, to grasp what is common to both either
through sight or through hearing. Let us consider another thing which
will show the truth of what we are saying. Suppose it were possible to
inquire whether both are salty or not. You can tell me, of course, with c
what you would examine them. It would clearly be neither sight nor
hearing, but something else.
THEAETETUS : Yes, of course; the power which functions through the
tongue.
SOCRATES : Good. Now through what does that power function which
reveals to you what is common in the case both of all things and of these
two—I mean that which you express by the words ‘is’and ‘is not’ and
the other terms used in our questions about them just now? What kind
of instruments will you assign for all these? Through what does that which
is percipient in us perceive all of them?
THEAETETUS : You mean being and not-being, likeness and unlikeness,
same and different; also one, and any other number applied to them. And d
obviously too your question is about odd and even, and all that is involved
with these attributes; and you want to know through what bodily instru-
ments we perceive all these with the soul.
SOCRATES : You follow me exceedingly well, Theaetetus. These are just
the things I am asking about.
THEAETETUS : But Icouldn’t possibly say. All I can tell you is that it doesn ’t
seem to me that for these things there is any special instrument at all, as
there is for the others. It seems to me that in investigating the common e
features of everything the soul functions through itself.
SOCRATES : Yes, Theaetetus, you would say that, because you are hand-
some and not ugly as Theodorus would have it.31For handsome is as
handsome says. And besides being handsome, you have done me a good
turn; you have saved me a vast amount of talk if it seems to you that,
while the soul considers some things through the bodily powers, there are
others which it considers alone and through itself. This was what I thought
myself, but I wanted you to think it too.
THEAETETUS : Well, it does seem to me to be so. 186
SOCRATES : Now in which class do you put being? For that, above all, is
something that accompanies everything.
THEAETETUS : I should put it among the things which the soul itself reaches
out after by itself.
SOCRATES : Also like and unlike, same and different?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : What about beautiful and ugly, good and bad?
31. Cf. 143e.206 Theaetetus
THEAETETUS : Yes, these too; in these, above all, I think the soul examines
their being in comparison with one another. Here it seems to be making b
a calculation within itself of past and present in relation to future.
SOCRATES : Not so fast, now. Wouldn’t you say that it is through touch
that the soul perceives the hardness of what is hard, and similarly the
softness of what is soft?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But as regards their being —the fact that they are —their oppo-
sition to one another, and the being, again, of this opposition, the matter
is different. Here the soul itself attempts to reach a decision for us by
rising to compare them with one another.
THEAETETUS : Yes, undoubtedly.
SOCRATES : And thus there are some things which all creatures, men and c
animals alike, are naturally able to perceive as soon as they are born; I mean,
the experiences which reach the soul through the body. But calculations
regarding their being and their advantageousness come, when they do,
only as the result of a long and arduous development, involving a good
deal of trouble and education.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that certainly is so.
SOCRATES : Now is it possible for someone who does not even get at being
to get at truth?
THEAETETUS : No; it’s impossible.
SOCRATES : And if a man fails to get at the truth of a thing, will he ever
be a person who knows that thing?
THEAETETUS : I don’t see how, Socrates. d
SOCRATES : Then knowledge is to be found not in the experiences but in
the process of reasoning about them; it is here, seemingly, not in the
experiences, that it is possible to grasp being and truth.
THEAETETUS : So it appears.
SOCRATES : Then in the face of such differences, would you call both by
the same name?
THEAETETUS : One would certainly have no right to.
SOCRATES : Now what name do you give to the former —seeing, hearing,
smelling, feeling cold or warm?
THEAETETUS : I call that perceiving —what else could I call it? e
SOCRATES : So the whole lot taken together you call perception?
THEAETETUS : Necessarily.
SOCRATES : Which, we say, has no share in the grasping of truth, since it
has none in the grasping of being.
THEAETETUS : No, it has none.
SOCRATES : So it has no share in knowledge either.
THEAETETUS : No.
SOCRATES : Then, Theaetetus, perception and knowledge could never be
the same thing.
THEAETETUS : No, apparently not, Socrates; we have now got the clearest
possible proof that knowledge is something different from perception.Theaetetus 207
SOCRATES : But our object in beginning this discussion was not to ﬁnd 187
out what knowledge is not, but to ﬁnd out what it is. However, we have
made a little progress. We shall not now look for knowledge in sense-
perception at all, but in whatever we call that activity of the soul when it
is busy by itself about the things which are.
THEAETETUS : Well, the name, Socrates, I suppose is judgment.
SOCRATES : Your opinion, my dear lad, is correct. Now look back to the
beginning. Wipe out all that we have said hitherto, and see if you can see b
any better from where you have now progressed to. Tell me again, what
is knowledge?
THEAETETUS : Well, Socrates, one can’t say that it is judgment in general,
because there is also false judgment —but true judgment may well be
knowledge. So let that be my answer. If the same thing happens again, and
weﬁnd, as we go on, that it turns out not to be so, we’ll try something else.
SOCRATES : And even so, Theaetetus, you have answered me in the way
one ought —with a good will, and not reluctantly, as you did at ﬁrst. If c
we continue like this, one of two things will happen. Either we shall ﬁnd
what we are going out after; or we shall be less inclined to think we know
things which we don’t know at all —and even that would be a reward we
could not fairly be dissatisﬁed with. Now what is this that you say? There
are two forms of judgment, true and false; and your deﬁnition is that true
judgment is knowledge?
THEAETETUS : Yes. That is how it looks to me now.
SOCRATES : Now I wonder if it’s worth while, at this stage, to go back to
an old point about judgment —
THEAETETUS : What point do you mean?
SOCRATES : I have something on my mind which has often bothered me d
before, and got me into great difﬁculty, both in my own thought and in
discussion with other people —I mean, I can’t say what it is, this experience
we have, and how it arises in us.
THEAETETUS : What experience?
SOCRATES : Judging what is false. Even now, you know, I’m still consider-
ing; I’m in two minds whether to let it go or whether to look into it in a
different manner from a short while ago.
THEAETETUS : Why not, Socrates, if this appears for any reason to be the
right thing to do? As you and Theodorus were saying just now, and quite
rightly, when you were talking about leisure, we are not pressed for time
in talk of this kind.
SOCRATES : A very proper reminder. Perhaps it would not be a bad mo- e
ment to go back upon our tracks. It is better to accomplish a little well
than a great deal unsatisfactorily.
THEAETETUS : Yes, it certainly is.
SOCRATES : Now how are we to proceed? And actually what is it that we
are saying? We claim, don’t we, that false judgment repeatedly occurs and
one of us judges falsely, the other truly, as if it was in the nature of things
for this to happen?208 Theaetetus
THEAETETUS : That is what we claim.
SOCRATES : Now isn’t it true about all things, together or individually, 188
that we must either know them or not know them? I am ignoring for the
moment the intermediate conditions of learning and forgetting, as they
don’t affect the argument here.
THEAETETUS : Of course, Socrates, in that case there is no alternative. With
each thing we either know it or we do not.
SOCRATES : Then when a man judges, the objects of his judgment are
necessarily either things which he knows or things which he doesn’t know?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that must be so.
SOCRATES : Yet if he knows a thing, it is impossible that he should not
know it; or if he does not know it, he cannot know it. b
THEAETETUS : Yes, of course.
SOCRATES : Now take the man who judges what is false. Is he thinking
that things which he knows are not these things but some other things
which he knows —so that knowing both he is ignorant of both?
THEAETETUS : But that would be impossible, Socrates.
SOCRATES : Then is he imagining that things which he doesn’t know are
other things which he doesn’t know? Is it possible that a man who knows
neither Theaetetus nor Socrates should take it into his head that Socrates
is Theaetetus or Theaetetus Socrates?
THEAETETUS : I don’t see how that could happen. c
SOCRATES : But a man certainly doesn’t think that things he knows are
things he does not know, or again that things he doesn’t know are things
he knows.
THEAETETUS : No, that would be a very odd thing.
SOCRATES : Then in what way is false judgment still possible? There is
evidently no possibility of judgment outside the cases we have mentioned,
since everything is either a thing we know or a thing we don’t know; and
within these limits there appears to be no place for false judgment to
be possible.
THEAETETUS : That’s perfectly true.
SOCRATES : Then perhaps we had better take up a different line of inquiry;
perhaps we should proceed not by way of knowing and not-knowing, but d
by way of being and not-being?
THEAETETUS : How do you mean?
SOCRATES : Perhaps the simple fact is this: it is when a man judges about
anything things which are not, that he is inevitably judging falsely, no
matter what may be the nature of his thought in other respects.
THEAETETUS : That again is very plausible, Socrates.
SOCRATES : Now how will that be? What are we going to say, Theaetetus,
if somebody sets about examining us, and we are asked, ‘Is what these
words express possible for anyone? Can a man judge what is not, either
about one of the things which are, or just by itself?’ I suppose we shall e
reply, ‘Yes, when he is thinking, but thinking what is not true.’ Or how
shall we answer?Theaetetus 209
THEAETETUS : That’s our answer.
SOCRATES : Now does this kind of thing happen elsewhere?
THEAETETUS : What kind of thing?
SOCRATES : Well, for instance, that a man sees something, yet sees nothing.
THEAETETUS : How could he?
SOCRATES : On the contrary, in fact, if he is seeing any one thing, he must
be seeing a thing which is. Or do you think that a ‘one’ can be found
among the things which are not?
THEAETETUS : I certainly don’t.
SOCRATES : Then a man who is seeing any one thing is seeing something
which is?
THEAETETUS : Apparently.
SOCRATES : It also follows that a man who is hearing anything is hearing 189
some one thing and something which is.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : And a man who is touching anything is touching some one
thing, and a thing which is, if it is one?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that also follows.
SOCRATES : And a man who is judging is judging some one thing, is he not?
THEAETETUS : Necessarily.
SOCRATES : And a man who is judging some one thing is judging some-
thing which is?
THEAETETUS : I grant that.
SOCRATES : Then that means that a man who is judging something which
is not is judging nothing?
THEAETETUS : So it appears.
SOCRATES : But a man who is judging nothing is not judging at all.
THEAETETUS : That seems clear.
SOCRATES : And so it is not possible to judge what is not, either about b
the things which are or just by itself.
THEAETETUS : Apparently not.
SOCRATES : False judgment, then, is something different from judging
things which are not?
THEAETETUS : It looks as if it were.
SOCRATES : Then neither on this approach nor on the one we followed
just now does false judgment exist in us.
THEAETETUS : No, indeed.
SOCRATES : Then is it in this way that the thing we call by that name arises?
THEAETETUS : How?
SOCRATES : We say that there is false judgment, a kind of ‘other-judging’, c
when a man, in place of one of the things that are, has substituted in his
thought another of the things that are and asserts that it is.32In this way,
32. Reading [anti tinos] for Burnet’s [ti] at 189c1; the latter reading would yield: ‘when
a man asserts that one of the things which are is another of the things which are, having
substituted one for the other in his thought’.210 Theaetetus
he is always judging something which is, but judges one thing in place of
another; and having missed the thing which was the object of his consider-
ation, he might fairly be called one who judges falsely.
THEAETETUS : Now you seem to me to have got it quite right. When a
man judges ‘ugly’ instead of ‘beautiful’,o r ‘beautiful’ instead of ‘ugly’,
then he is truly judging what is false.
SOCRATES : Evidently, Theaetetus, you have not much opinion of me; you
don’t ﬁnd me at all alarming.
THEAETETUS : What in particular makes you say that?
SOCRATES : Well, I suppose you don’t think me capable of taking up your d
‘truly false’, and asking you whether it is possible that a thing should be
slowly swift, or heavily light, or whether anything else can possibly occur
in a way not in accordance with its own nature but in accordance with
that of its opposite and contrary to itself. But let that pass; I don’t want
your boldness to go unrewarded. You like the suggestion, you say, that
false judgment is ‘other-judging’?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I do.
SOCRATES : Then, according to your judgment, it is possible to set down
a thing in one’s thought as another thing and not itself?
THEAETETUS : Surely it is.
SOCRATES : Now when a man’s thought is accomplishing this, isn’t it e
essential that he should be thinking of either one or both of these two
things?
THEAETETUS : It is essential; either both together, or each in turn.
SOCRATES : Very good. Now by ‘thinking’ do you mean the same as I do?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean by it?
SOCRATES : A talk which the soul has with itself about the objects under
its consideration. Of course, I’m only telling you my idea in all ignorance;
but this is the kind of picture I have of it. It seems to me that the soul
when it thinks is simply carrying on a discussion in which it asks itself 190
questions and answers them itself, afﬁrms and denies. And when it arrives
at something deﬁnite, either by a gradual process or a sudden leap, when
it afﬁrms one thing consistently and without divided counsel, we call this
its judgment. So, in my view, to judge is to make a statement, and a
judgment is a statement which is not addressed to another person or
spoken aloud, but silently addressed to oneself. And what do you think?
THEAETETUS : I agree with that.
SOCRATES : So that when a man judges one thing to be another, what he
is doing, apparently, is to say to himself that the one thing is the other.
THEAETETUS : Yes, of course. b
SOCRATES : Now try to think if you have ever said to yourself ‘Surely the
beautiful is ugly’,33or ‘The unjust is certainly just’. Or—to put it in the
most general terms—have you ever tried to persuade yourself that ‘Surely
33. The Greek idiom here could be used to say either that some particular beautiful
thing is ugly, or that beauty is ugliness.Theaetetus 211
one thing is another ’? Wouldn’t the very opposite of this be the truth?
Wouldn’t the truth be that not even in your sleep have you ever gone so
far as to say to yourself ‘No doubt the odd is even ’, or anything of that kind?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s so.
SOCRATES : And do you think that anyone else, in his right mind or out c
of it, ever ventured seriously to tell himself, with the hope of winning his
own assent, that ‘A cow must be a horse ’or‘Two must be one ’?
THEAETETUS : No, indeed I don ’t.
SOCRATES : Well, then, if to make a statement to oneself is to judge, no
one who makes a statement, that is, a judgment, about both things, getting
hold of both with his soul, can state, or judge, that one is the other. And
you, in your turn, must let this form of words pass.34What I mean by it
is this: no one judges ‘The ugly is beautiful ’or makes any other such d
judgment.
THEAETETUS : All right, Socrates, I pass it; and I think you ’re right.
SOCRATES : Thus a man who has both things before his mind when he
judges cannot possibly judge that one is the other.
THEAETETUS : So it seems.
SOCRATES : But if he has only one of them before his mind in judging,
and the other is not present to him at all, he will never judge that one is
the other.
THEAETETUS : That’s true. For he would have to have hold also of the one
that is not present to his judgment.
SOCRATES : Then ‘other-judging’ is not possible for anyone either when
he has both things present to him in judgment or when he has one only. e
So, if anyone is going to de ﬁne false judgment as ‘heterodoxy’,35he will
be saying nothing. The existence of false judgment in us cannot be shown
in this way any more than by our previous approaches.
THEAETETUS : It seems not.
SOCRATES : And yet, Theaetetus, if it is not shown to exist, we shall be
driven into admitting a number of absurdities.
THEAETETUS : And what would they be?
SOCRATES : I am not going to tell you until I have tried every possible
way of looking at this matter. I should be ashamed to see us forced into 191
making the kind of admissions I mean while we are still in dif ﬁculties. If
weﬁnd what we’re after, and become free men, then we will turn round
and talk about how these things happen to other people —having secured
our own persons against ridicule. While if we can’t ﬁnd any way of
34. In the Greek the opposition here between ‘one’ and ‘the other’ is expressed by
the repetition of the word meaning ‘other’—thus yielding, literally, the unparadoxical
tautology ‘the other is other’. As Socrates refrained at 189c –d from taking up the paradoxi-
cal construal of Theaetetus’‘ truly false’, so Theaetetus must refrain from taking up this
unparadoxical construal of Socrates ’‘one is the other ’.
35. A transliteration of a variant Greek expression for ‘other-judging’ that Socrates
uses here.212 Theaetetus
extricating ourselves, then I suppose we shall be laid low, like seasick
passengers, and give ourselves into the hands of the argument and let it
trample all over us and do what it likes with us. And now let me tell you
where I see a way still open to this inquiry.
THEAETETUS : Yes, do tell me.
SOCRATES : I am going to maintain that we were wrong to agree that it
is impossible for a man to be in error through judging that things he knows b
are things he doesn’t know. In a way, it is possible.
THEAETETUS : Now I wonder if you mean the same thing as I too suspected
at the time when we suggested it was like that —I mean, that sometimes
I, who know Socrates, have seen someone else in the distance whom I
don’t know and thought it to be Socrates whom I do know. In a case like
that, the sort of thing you are referring to does happen.
SOCRATES : But didn’t we recoil from this suggestion because it made us
not know, when we do know, things which we know?
THEAETETUS : Yes, we certainly did.
SOCRATES : Then don’t let us put the case in that way; let‘s try another
way. It may prove amenable or it may be obstinate; but the fact is we are c
in such an extremity that we need to turn every argument over and over
and test it from all sides. Now see if there is anything in this. Is it possible
to learn something you didn’t know before?
THEAETETUS : Surely it is.
SOCRATES : And again another and yet another thing?
THEAETETUS : Well, why not?
SOCRATES : Now I want you to suppose, for the sake of the argument,
that we have in our souls a block of wax, larger in one person, smaller in
another, and of purer wax in one case, dirtier in another; in some men rather d
hard, in others rather soft, while in some it is of the proper consistency.
THEAETETUS : All right, I’m supposing that.
SOCRATES : We may look upon it, then, as a gift of Memory, the mother
of the Muses. We make impressions upon this of everything we wish to
remember among the things we have seen or heard or thought of ourselves;
we hold the wax under our perceptions and thoughts and take a stamp
from them, in the way in which we take the imprints of signet rings.
Whatever is impressed upon the wax we remember and know so long as
the image remains in the wax; whatever is obliterated or cannot be im- e
pressed, we forget and do not know.
THEAETETUS : Let that be our supposition.
SOCRATES : Then take the case of a man who knows these things, but is
also considering something he is seeing or hearing; and see if he might
judge falsely in this way.
THEAETETUS : In what kind of way?
SOCRATES : In thinking, of things which he knows, sometimes that they
are things which he knows and sometimes that they are things which he
doesn’t know —these cases being what at an earlier stage we wrongly
admitted to be impossible.
THEAETETUS : And what do you say now?Theaetetus 213
SOCRATES : We must begin this discussion by making certain distinctions. 192
We must make it clear that it is impossible to think (1) that a thing you
know, because you possess the record of it in your soul, but which you
are not perceiving, is another thing which you know —you have its imprint
too—but are not perceiving, (2) that a thing you know is something you
do not know and do not have the seal of, (3) that a thing you don’t know
is another thing you don’t know, (4) that a thing you don’t know is a thing
you know.
Again, it is impossible to think (1) that a thing you are perceiving is
another thing that you are perceiving, (2) that a thing you are perceiving
is a thing which you are not perceiving, (3) that a thing you are not b
perceiving is another thing you are not perceiving, (4) that a thing you
are not perceiving is a thing you are perceiving.
Yet again, it is impossible to think (1) that a thing you both know and are
perceiving, when you are holding its imprint in line with your perception of
it, is another thing which you know and are perceiving, and whose imprint
you keep in line with the perception (this indeed is even more impossible
than the former cases, if that can be), (2) that a thing which you both know
and are perceiving, and the record of which you are keeping in its true
line, is another thing you know, (3) that a thing you both know and are
perceiving and of which you have the record correctly in line as before,
is another thing you are perceiving, (4) that a thing you neither know nor c
are perceiving is another thing you neither know nor perceive, (5) that a
thing you neither know nor perceive is another thing you don’t know,
(6) that a thing you neither know nor perceive is another thing you are
not perceiving.
In all these cases, it is a sheer impossibility that there should be false
judgment. It remains that it arises, if anywhere, in the cases I am just going
to tell you.
THEAETETUS : What are they? Perhaps I may understand a little better
from them; at present, I don’t follow.
SOCRATES : In these cases of things you know: when you think (1) that
they are other things you know and are perceiving, (2) that they are things
you don’t know but are perceiving, (3) that things you both know and are d
perceiving are other things you both know and are perceiving.
THEAETETUS : Well, now you have left me further behind than ever.
SOCRATES :I’ll go over it again in another way. I know Theodorus and
remember within myself what he is like; and in the same way I know
Theaetetus. But sometimes I am seeing them and sometimes not; sometimes
I am touching them, and sometimes not; or I may hear them or perceive
them through some other sense, while at other times I have no perception
about you two at all, but remember you none the less, and know you
within myself —isn’t that so?
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly. e
SOCRATES : Now please take this ﬁrst point that I want to make clear to
you—that we sometimes perceive and sometimes do not perceive the
things that we know.214 Theaetetus
THEAETETUS : That’s true.
SOCRATES : Then as regards the things we don’t know, we often don’t
perceive them either, but often we only perceive them.
THEAETETUS : That is so, also.
SOCRATES : Now see if you can follow me a little better. Supposing Socrates 193
knows both Theodorus and Theaetetus, but is not seeing either of them,
or having any other perception about them: he could never in that case
judge within himself that Theaetetus was Theodorus. Is that sense or not?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s quite true.
SOCRATES : This, then, was the ﬁrst of the cases I was speaking of.
THEAETETUS : It was.
SOCRATES : Secondly then. Supposing I am acquainted with one of you
and not the other, and am perceiving neither of you: in that case, I could
never think the one I do know to be the one I don’t know.
THEAETETUS : That is so.
SOCRATES : Thirdly, supposing I am not acquainted with either of you, b
and am not perceiving either of you: I could not possibly think that one
of you, whom I don’t know, is another of you whom I don’t know. Now
will you please take it that you have heard all over again in succession
the other cases described before —the cases in which I shall never judge
falsely about you and Theodorus, either when I am familiar or when I am
unfamiliar with both of you; or when I know one and not the other. And
similarly with perceptions, you follow me.
THEAETETUS : I follow.
SOCRATES : So there remains the possibility of false judgment in this case.
I know both you and Theodorus; I have your signs upon that block of c
wax, like the imprints of rings. Then I see you both in the distance, but
cannot see you well enough; but I am in a hurry to refer the proper sign
to the proper visual perception, and so get this ﬁtted into the trace of itself,
that recognition may take place. This I fail to do; I get them out of line,
applying the visual perception of the one to the sign of the other. It is like
people putting their shoes on the wrong feet, or like what happens when
we look at things in mirrors, when left and right change places. It is then d
that ‘heterodoxy’ or false judgment arises.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that seems very likely, Socrates; it is an awfully good
description of what happens to the judgment.
SOCRATES : Then, again, supposing I know both of you, and am also
perceiving one of you, and not the other, but am not keeping my knowledge
of the former in line with my perception —that’s the expression I used
before and you didn’t understand me then.
THEAETETUS : No, I certainly didn’t.
SOCRATES : Well, I was saying that if you know one man and perceive
him as well, and keep your knowledge of him in line with your perception, e
you will never take him for some other person whom you know and are
perceiving, and the knowledge of whom you are holding straight with the
perception. Wasn’t that so?
THEAETETUS : Yes.Theaetetus 215
SOCRATES : There remained, I take it, the case we have just mentioned
where false judgment arises in the following manner: you know both men 194
and you are looking at both, or having some other perception of them;
and you don’t hold the two signs each in line with its own perception,
but like a bad archer you shoot beside the mark and miss—which is
precisely what we call falsehood.
THEAETETUS : Naturally so.
SOCRATES : And when for one of the signs there is also a present perception
but there is not for the other, and you try to ﬁt to the present perception the
sign belonging to the absent perception, in all such cases thought is in error.
We may sum up thus: it seems that in the case of things we do not b
know and have never perceived, there is no possibility of error or of false
judgment, if what we are saying is at all sound; it is in cases where we
both know things and are perceiving them that judgment is erratic and
varies between truth and falsity. When it brings together the proper stamps
and records directly and in straight lines, it is true; when it does so obliquely
and crosswise, it is false.
THEAETETUS : Well, isn’t that beautiful, Socrates?
SOCRATES : Ah, when you’ve heard what is coming next, you will say so c
all the more. For true judgment is beautiful, right enough, and error is ugly.
THEAETETUS : No doubt about that.
SOCRATES : Well, this, then, they say, is why the two things occur. In some
men, the wax in the soul is deep and abundant, smooth and worked to
the proper consistency; and when the things that come through the senses
are imprinted upon this ‘heart’ of the soul—as Homer calls it, hinting at
the likeness to the wax36—the signs that are made in it are lasting, because d
they are clear and have sufﬁcient depth. Men with such souls learn easily
and remember what they learn; they do not get the signs out of line with
the perceptions, but judge truly. As the signs are distinct and there is
plenty of room for them, they quickly assign each thing to its own impress
in the wax—the things in question being, of course, what we call the things
that are and these people being the ones we call wise.
Or do you feel any doubts about this?
THEAETETUS : No, I ﬁnd it extraordinarily convincing.
SOCRATES : But it is a different matter when a man’s ‘heart’ is ‘shaggy’ e
(the kind of heart our marvellously knowing poet praises), or when it is
dirty and of impure wax; or when it is very soft or hard. Persons in whom
the wax is soft are quick to learn but quick to forget; when the wax is
hard, the opposite happens. Those in whom it is ‘shaggy’ and rugged, a
stony thing with earth or ﬁlth mixed all through it, have indistinct impres-
sions. So too if the wax is hard, for then the impressions have no depth;
similarly they are indistinct if the wax is soft, because they quickly run 195
together and are blurred. If, in addition to all this, the impresses in the
wax are crowded upon each other for lack of space, because it is only
36.Iliad ii.851, xvi.554. The word for ‘heart’ attributed to Homer here is kear, which has
a superﬁcial resemblance to the word for wax, ke¯ros.216 Theaetetus
some little scrap of a soul, they are even more indistinct. All such people
are liable to false judgment. When they see or hear or think of anything,
they can’t quickly allot each thing to each impress; they are slow and allot
things to impresses which do not belong to them, misseeing, mishearing
and misthinking most of them —and these in turn are the ones we describe
as in error about the things that are and ignorant.
THEAETETUS : That’s exactly it, Socrates; no man could improve on b
your account.
SOCRATES : Then are we to say that false judgments do exist in us?
THEAETETUS : Yes, most emphatically.
SOCRATES : And true ones, of course?
THEAETETUS : And true ones.
SOCRATES : And we think we have now reached a satisfactory agreement,
when we say that these two kinds of judgment certainly exist?
THEAETETUS : There’s no earthly doubt about it, Socrates.
SOCRATES : Theaetetus, I’m afraid a garrulous man is really an awful nui-
sance.
THEAETETUS : Why, what are you talking about?
SOCRATES :I’m annoyed at my own stupidity —my own true garrulous- c
ness. What else could you call it when a man will keep dragging arguments
up and down, because he is too slow-witted to reach any conviction, and
will not be pulled off any of them?
THEAETETUS : But why should yoube annoyed?
SOCRATES : I am not only annoyed; I am alarmed. I am afraid of what I
may say if someone asks me: ‘So, Socrates, you’ve discovered false judg-
ment, have you? You have found that it arises not in the relation of
perceptions to one another, or of thoughts to one another, but in the d
connecting of perception with thought?’ I believe I am very likely to say
‘Yes’, with an air of ﬂattering myself upon our having made some beauti-
ful discovery.
THEAETETUS : Well, Socrates, what you have just shown us looks to me
quite a presentable thing anyway.
SOCRATES :‘You mean’, he goes on, ‘that we would never suppose that
a man we are merely thinking of but not seeing is a horse which again
we are not seeing or touching, but just thinking of and not perceiving
anything else about it?’ I suppose I shall agree that we do mean this.
THEAETETUS : Yes, and quite rightly.
SOCRATES :’Well then,’ he goes on, ‘doesn’t it follow from this theory e
that a man couldn’t possibly suppose that eleven, which he is merely
thinking about, is twelve, which again he is merely thinking about?’ Come
now, you answer.
THEAETETUS : Well, my answer will be that someone who is seeing or
touching them could suppose that eleven are twelve, but not with those that
he has in his thought: he would never judge this in that way about them.
SOCRATES : Well, now, take the case where a man is considering ﬁve and 196
seven within himself —I don’t mean seven men and ﬁve men, or anythingTheaetetus 217
of that sort, but ﬁve and seven themselves; the records, as we allege, in
that waxen block, things among which it is not possible that there should
be false judgment. Suppose he is talking to himself about them, and asking
himself how many they are. Do you think that in such a case it has ever
happened that one man thought they were eleven and said so, while
another thought and said that they were twelve? Or do all men say and
all men think that they are twelve?
THEAETETUS : Oh, good Heavens, no; lots of people would make them b
eleven. And with larger numbers they go wrong still more often —for I
suppose what you say is intended to apply to all numbers.
SOCRATES : Quite right. And I want you to consider whether what happens
here is not just this, that a man thinks that twelve itself, the one on the
waxen block, is eleven.
THEAETETUS : It certainly looks as if he does.
SOCRATES : Then haven’t we come back to the things we were saying at
the outset? You see, anyone to whom this happens is thinking that one
thing he knows is another thing he knows. And this we said was impossible;
in fact, it was just this consideration which led us to exclude the possibility
of false judgment, because, if admitted, it would mean that the same man c
must, at one and the same time, both know and not know the same objects.
THEAETETUS : That’s perfectly true.
SOCRATES : Then we shall have to say that false judgment is something
other than a misapplication of thought to perception; because if this were
so, we could never be in error so long as we remained within our thoughts
themselves. But as the matter now stands, either there is no such thing
as false judgment; or a man may not know what he knows. Which do
you choose?
THEAETETUS : You are offering me an impossible choice, Socrates.
SOCRATES : But I’m afraid the argument will not permit both. Still — d
we must stop at nothing; supposing now we were to set about being
quite shameless?
THEAETETUS : How?
SOCRATES : By consenting to say what knowing is like.
THEAETETUS : And why should that be shameless?
SOCRATES : You don’t seem to realize that our whole discussion from the
beginning has been an inquiry about knowledge, on the assumption that
we do not yet know what it is.
THEAETETUS :O hb u tId o .
SOCRATES : Well, then, don’t you think it is a shameless thing that we,
who don’t know what knowledge is, should pronounce on what knowing e
is like? But as a matter of fact, Theaetetus, for some time past our whole
method of discussion has been tainted. Time and again we have said ‘we
are acquainted with’ and ‘we are not acquainted with’, ‘we know’ and
‘we do not know’, as if we could to some extent understand one another
while we are still ignorant of what knowledge is. Or here’s another example,
if you like: at this very moment, we have again used the words ‘to be218 Theaetetus
ignorant of’, and ‘to understand’, as if these were quite proper expressions
for us when we are deprived of knowledge.
THEAETETUS : But how are you going to carry on the discussion at all,
Socrates, if you keep off these words?
SOCRATES : Quite impossible, for a man like me; but if I were one of the 197
experts in contradiction, I might be able to. If one of those gentlemen were
present, he would have commanded us to refrain from them, and would
keep coming down upon us heavily for the faults I’m referring to. But
since we are no good anyway, why don’t I make bold to tell you what
knowing is like? It seems to me that this might be of some help.
THEAETETUS : Then do be bold, please. And if you don’t keep from using
these words, we’ll forgive you all right.
SOCRATES : Well, then, have you heard what people are saying nowadays
that knowing is?
THEAETETUS : I dare say I have; but I don’t remember it at the moment.
SOCRATES : Well, they say, of course, that it is ‘the having of knowledge’. b
THEAETETUS : Oh, yes, that’s true.
SOCRATES : Let us make a slight change; let us say ‘the possession of
knowledge’.
THEAETETUS : And how would you say that was different from the ﬁrst
way of putting it?
SOCRATES : Perhaps it isn’t at all; but I will tell you what I think the
difference is, and then you must help me to examine it.
THEAETETUS : All right —if I can.
SOCRATES : Well, then, to ‘possess’ doesn’t seem to me to be the same as
to‘have’. For instance, suppose a man has bought a coat and it is at his
disposal but he is not wearing it; we would not say that he ‘has’ it on, but
we would say he ‘possesses’ it.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that would be correct.
SOCRATES : Now look here: is it possible in this way to possess knowledge c
and not ‘have’ it? Suppose a man were to hunt wild birds, pigeons or
something, and make an aviary for them at his house and look after them
there; then, in a sense, I suppose, we might say he ‘has’ them all the time,
because of course he possesses them. Isn’t that so?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But in another sense he ‘has’ none of them; it is only that he
has acquired a certain power in respect of them, because he has got them
under his control in an enclosure of his own. That is to say, he has the d
power to hunt for any one he likes at any time, and take and ‘have’ it
whenever he chooses, and let it go again; and this he can do as often as
he likes.
THEAETETUS : That is so.
SOCRATES : Well a little while ago we were equipping souls with I don’t
know what sort of a waxen device. Now let us make in each soul a sort
of aviary of all kinds of birds; some in ﬂocks separate from the others,Theaetetus 219
some in small groups, and others ﬂying about singly here and there among
all the rest.
THEAETETUS : All right, let us suppose it made. What then? e
SOCRATES : Then we must say that when we are children this receptacle
is empty; and by the birds we must understand pieces of knowledge.
When anyone takes possession of a piece of knowledge and shuts it up
in the pen, we should say that he has learned or has found out the thing
of which this is the knowledge; and knowing, we should say, is this.
THEAETETUS : That’s given, then.
SOCRATES : Now think: when he hunts again for any one of the pieces of 198
knowledge that he chooses, and takes it and ‘has’ it, then lets it go again,
what words are appropriate here? The same as before, when he took
possession of the knowledge, or different ones? —You will see my point
more clearly in this way. There is an art you call arithmetic, isn’t there?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Now I want you to think of this as a hunt for pieces of
knowledge concerning everything odd and even.
THEAETETUS : All right, I will.
SOCRATES : It is by virtue of this art, I suppose, that a man both has under b
his control pieces of knowledge concerning numbers and also hands them
over to others?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : And we call it ‘teaching’ when a man hands them over to
others, and ‘learning’ when he gets them handed over to him; and when
he‘has’ them through possessing them in this aviary of ours, we call
that ‘knowing’.
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly.
SOCRATES : Now you must give your attention to what is coming next.
It must surely be true that a man who has completely mastered arithmetic
knows all numbers? Because there are pieces of knowledge covering all
numbers in his soul.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
SOCRATES : And a man so trained may proceed to do some counting, c
either counting to himself the numbers themselves, or counting something
else, one of the external things which have number?
THEAETETUS : Yes, surely.
SOCRATES : And counting we shall take to be simply a matter of consider-
ing how large a number actually is?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Then it looks as if this man were considering something which
he knows as if he did not know it (for we have granted that he knows all
numbers). I’ve no doubt you’ve had such puzzles put to you.
THEAETETUS : I have, yes.
SOCRATES : Then using our image of possessing and hunting for the pi- d
geons, we shall say that there are two phases of hunting; one before you220 Theaetetus
have possession in order to get possession, and another when you already
possess in order to catch and have in your hands what you previously
acquired. And in this way even with things you learned and got the
knowledge of long ago and have known ever since, it is possible to learn
them —these same things —all over again. You can take up again and ‘have’
that knowledge of each of them which you acquired long ago but had not
ready to hand in your thought, can’t you?
THEAETETUS : True.
SOCRATES : Now this is what I meant by my question a moment ago. e
What terms ought we to use about them when we speak of what the
arithmetician does when he proceeds to count, or the scholar when he
proceeds to read something? Here, it seems, a man who knows something
is setting out to learn again from himself things which he already knows.
THEAETETUS : But that would be a very odd thing, Socrates.
SOCRATES : But are we to say that it is things which he does not know
that such a man is going to read and count —remembering that we have 199
granted him knowledge of all letters and all numbers?
THEAETETUS : That wouldn’t be reasonable, either.
SOCRATES : Then would you like us to take this line? Suppose we say we
do not mind at all about the names; let people drag around the terms
‘knowing’ and ‘learning’ to their heart’s content. We have determined that
to‘possess’ knowledge is one thing and to ‘have’ it is another; accordingly
we maintain that it is impossible for anyone not to possess that which he
has possession of, and thus, it never happens that he does not know
something he knows. But he may yet make a false judgment about it. This
is because it is possible for him to ‘have’, not the knowledge of this thing, b
but another piece of knowledge instead. When he is hunting for one piece
of knowledge, it may happen, as they ﬂy about, that he makes a mistake
and gets hold of one instead of another. It was this that happened when
he thought eleven was twelve. He got hold of the knowledge of eleven
that was in him, instead of the knowledge of twelve, as you might catch
a ring-dove instead of a pigeon.
THEAETETUS : Yes; that is reasonable, now.
SOCRATES : But when he gets hold of the one he is trying to get hold of,
then he is free from error; when he does that, he is judging what is. In
this way, both true and false judgment exist; and the things that worried c
us before no longer stand in our way. I daresay you’ll agree with me? Or,
if not, what line will you take?
THEAETETUS : I agree.
SOCRATES : Yes; we have now got rid of this ‘not knowing what one
knows’. For we now ﬁnd that at no point does it happen that we do not
possess what we possess, whether we are in error about anything or not.
But it looks to me as if something else more alarming is by way of coming
upon us.
THEAETETUS : What’s that?Theaetetus 221
SOCRATES : I mean, what is involved if false judgment is going to become
a matter of an interchange of pieces of knowledge.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
SOCRATES : To begin with, it follows that a man who has knowledge of d
something is ignorant of this very thing not through want of knowledge
but actually in virtue of his knowledge. Secondly, he judges that this is
something else and that the other thing is it. Now surely this is utterly
unreasonable; it means that the soul, when knowledge becomes present
to it, knows nothing and is wholly ignorant. According to this argument,
there is no reason why an accession of ignorance should not make one
know something, or of blindness make one see something, if knowledge
is ever going to make a man ignorant.
THEAETETUS : Well, perhaps, Socrates, it wasn’t a happy thought to make e
the birds only pieces of knowledge. Perhaps we ought to have supposed
that there are pieces of ignorance also ﬂying about in the soul along with
them, and what happens is that the hunter sometimes catches a piece of
knowledge and sometimes a piece of ignorance concerning the same thing;
and the ignorance makes him judge falsely, while the knowledge makes
him judge truly.
SOCRATES : I can hardly refrain from expressing my admiration of you,
Theaetetus; but do think again about that. Let us suppose it is as you say:
then, you maintain, the man who catches a piece of ignorance will judge 200
falsely. Is that it?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But presumably he will not think he is judging falsely?
THEAETETUS : No, of course he won’t.
SOCRATES : He will think he is judging what is true; and his attitude
towards the things about which he is in error will be as if he knew them.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
SOCRATES : He will think he has hunted down and ‘has’ a piece of knowl-
edge and not a piece of ignorance.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s clear.
SOCRATES : So, after going a long way round, we are back at our original
difﬁculty. Our friend the expert in refutation will laugh. ‘My very good b
people,’ he will say, ‘do you mean that a man who knows both knowledge
and ignorance is thinking that one of them which he knows is the other
which he knows? Or is it that he knows neither, and judges the one he
doesn’t know to be the other which he doesn’t know? Or is it that he
knows one and not the other, and judges that the one he knows is the one
he doesn’t know? Or does he think that the one he doesn’t know is the
one he does? Or are you going to start all over again and tell me that
there’s another set of pieces of knowledge concerning pieces of knowledge
and ignorance, which a man may possess shut up in some other ridiculous
aviaries or waxen devices, which he knows so long as he possesses them c
though he may not have them ready to hand in his soul —and in this way222 Theaetetus
end up forced to come running round to the same place over and over again
and never get any further?’ What are we going to say to that, Theaetetus?
THEAETETUS : Oh, dear me, Socrates, I don’t know what one ought to say.
SOCRATES : Then don’t you think, my boy, that the argument is perhaps
dealing out a little proper chastisement, and showing us that we were
wrong to leave the question about knowledge and proceed to inquire into d
false judgment ﬁrst? While as a matter of fact it’s impossible to know this
until we have an adequate grasp of what knowledge is.
THEAETETUS : Well, at the moment, Socrates, I feel bound to believe you.
SOCRATES : Then, to go back to the beginning, what are we going to say
knowledge is?—We are not, I suppose, going to give up yet?
THEAETETUS : Certainly not, unless you give up yourself.
SOCRATES : Tell me, then, how could we deﬁne it with the least risk of
contradicting ourselves?
THEAETETUS : In the way we were attempting before, Socrates; I can’t e
think of any other.
SOCRATES : In what way do you mean?
THEAETETUS : By saying that knowledge is true judgment. Judging truly
is at least something free of mistakes, I take it, and everything that results
from it is admirable and good.
SOCRATES : Well, Theaetetus, as the man who was leading the way across
the river said, ‘It will show you.’37If we go on and track this down, perhaps 201
we may stumble on what we are looking for; if we stay where we are,
nothing will come clear.
THEAETETUS : You’re right; let’s go on and consider it.
SOCRATES : Well, this won’t take long to consider, anyway; there is a
whole art indicating to you that knowledge is not what you say.
THEAETETUS : How’s that? What art do you mean?
SOCRATES : The art of the greatest representatives of wisdom—the men
called orators and lawyers. These men, I take it, use their art to produce
conviction not by teaching people, but by making them judge whatever
they themselves choose. Or do you think there are any teachers so clever
that within the short time allowed by the clock they can teach adequately b
to people who were not eye-witnesses the truth of what happened to
people who have been robbed or assaulted?
THEAETETUS : No, I don’t think they possibly could; but they might be
able to persuade them.
SOCRATES : And by ‘persuading them’, you mean ‘causing them to judge’,
don’t you?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
SOCRATES : Then suppose a jury has been justly persuaded of some matter
which only an eye-witness could know, and which cannot otherwise be
37. According to the scholiast the story was: some travellers came to the bank of a river,
which they wished to cross at the ford; one of them asked the guide, ‘Is the water deep?’
He said, ‘It will show you’, i.e., you must try it for yourself.Theaetetus 223
known; suppose they come to their decision upon hearsay, forming a c
true judgment: then they have decided the case without knowledge, but,
granted they did their job well, being correctly persuaded?
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly.
SOCRATES : But, my dear lad, they couldn ’t have done that if true judgment
is the same thing as knowledge; in that case the best juryman in the world
couldn’t form a correct judgment without knowledge. So it seems they
must be different things.
THEAETETUS : Oh, yes, Socrates, that ’s just what I once heard a man say;
I had forgotten, but now it ’s coming back to me. He said that it is true d
judgment with an account38that is knowledge; true judgment without an
account falls outside of knowledge. And he said that the things of which
there is no account are not knowable (yes, he actually called them that),39
while those which have an account are knowable.
SOCRATES : Very good indeed. Now tell me, how did he distinguish these
knowables and unknowables? I want to see if you and I have heard the
same version.
THEAETETUS : I don’t know if I can ﬁnd that out; but I think I could follow
if someone explained it.
SOCRATES : Listen then to a dream in return for a dream. In my dream,
too, I thought I was listening to people saying that the primary elements, e
as it were, of which we and everything else are composed, have no account.
Each of them, in itself, can only be named; it is not possible to say anything
else of it, either that it is or that it is not. That would mean that we were 202
adding being or not-being to it; whereas we must not attach anything, if
we are to speak of that thing itself alone. Indeed we ought not to apply
to it even such words as ‘itself’ or‘that’, ‘each’, ‘alone’,o r‘this’,o ra n y
other of the many words of this kind; for these go the round and are
applied to all things alike, being other than the things to which they are
added, whereas if it were possible to express the element itself and it had
its own proprietary account, it would have to be expressed without any
other thing. As it is, however, it is impossible that any of the primaries b
should be expressed in an account; it can only be named, for a name is
all that it has. But with the things composed of these, it is another matter.
Here, just in the same way as the elements themselves are woven together,
so their names may be woven together and become an account of some-
thing —an account being essentially a complex of names. Thus the elements
are unaccountable and unknowable, but they are perceivable, whereas the
38.‘Account’ translates logos, which can also mean ‘statement,’‘ argument’, ‘speech’,
and ‘discourse’.
39. The parenthesis may alternatively be translated: ‘(that was the word he used) ’. The
translation in the text expresses surprise about the claim that some things are not know-
able at all. The alternative translation calls attention to the particular Greek word used
for‘knowable’.224 Theaetetus
complexes are both knowable and expressible and can be the objects of
true judgment.
Now when a man gets a true judgment about something without an c
account, his soul is in a state of truth as regards that thing, but he does
not know it; for someone who cannot give and take an account of a thing
is ignorant about it. But when he has also got an account of it, he is capable
of all this and is made perfect in knowledge. Was the dream you heard
the same as this or a different one?
THEAETETUS : No, it was the same in every respect.
SOCRATES : Do you like this then, and do you suggest that knowledge is
true judgment with an account?
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly.
SOCRATES : Theaetetus, can it be that all in a moment, you and I have d
today laid hands upon something which many a wise man has searched
for in the past —and gone gray before he found it?
THEAETETUS : Well, it does seem to me anyway, Socrates, that what has
just been said puts the matter very well.
SOCRATES : And it seems likely enough that the matter is really so; for what
knowledge could there be apart from an account and correct judgment? But
there is one of the things said which I don ’t like.
THEAETETUS : And what’s that?
SOCRATES : What looks like the subtlest point of all —that the elements
are unknowable and the complexes knowable. e
THEAETETUS : And won’t that do?
SOCRATES : We must make sure; because, you see, we do have as hostages
for this theory the original models that were used when all these statements
were made.
THEAETETUS : What models?
SOCRATES : Letters —the elements of language —and syllables.40It must
have been these, mustn’t it, that the author of our theory had in view —
it couldn’t have been anything else?
THEAETETUS : No, he must have been thinking of letters and syllables.
SOCRATES : Let’s take and examine them then. Or rather let us examine 203
ourselves, and ask ourselves whether we really learned our letters in this
way or not. Now, to begin with, one can give an account of the syllables
but not of the letters —is that it?
THEAETETUS : Well, perhaps.
SOCRATES : It most certainly looks like that to me. At any rate, supposing
you were asked about the ﬁrst syllable of ‘Socrates’: ‘Tell me, Theaetetus,
what is SO?’ What would you answer to that?
THEAETETUS : That it’s S and O.
SOCRATES : And there you have an account of the syllable?
40.‘Letters’ translates stoicheia, which can also mean ‘elements’ more generally (and
is so translated sometimes below). ‘Syllables’: in Greek sullabai, also translated below
as‘complexes.’Theaetetus 225
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Come along then, and let us have the account of S in the b
same way.
THEAETETUS : How cananyone give the letters of a letter? S is just one of
the voiceless letters, Socrates, a mere sound like a hissing of the tongue.
B again has neither voice nor sound, and that ’s true of most letters. So the
statement that they themselves are unaccountable holds perfectly good.
Even the seven clearest have only voice; no sort of account whatever can
be given of them.41
SOCRATES : So here, my friend, we have established a point about
knowledge.
THEAETETUS : We do appear to have done so.
SOCRATES : Well then: we have shown that the syllable is knowable but c
not the letter —is that all right?
THEAETETUS : It seems the natural conclusion, anyway.
SOCRATES : Look here, what do we mean by ‘the syllable’? The two letters
(or if there are more, all the letters)? Or do we mean some single form
produced by their combination?
THEAETETUS : I think we mean all the letters.
SOCRATES : Then take the case of the two letters, S and O; these two are
theﬁrst syllable of my name. If a man knows the syllable, he must know
both the letters?
THEAETETUS : Of course. d
SOCRATES : So he knows S and O.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But can it be that he is ignorant of each one, and knows the
two of them without knowing either?
THEAETETUS : That would be a strange and unaccountable thing, Socrates.
SOCRATES : And yet, supposing it is necessary to know each in order to
know both, then it is absolutely necessary that anyone who is ever to know
a syllable must ﬁrst get to know the letters. And in admitting this, we
shall ﬁnd that our beautiful theory has taken to its heels and got clean
away from us.
THEAETETUS : And very suddenly too. e
SOCRATES : Yes; we are not keeping a proper watch on it. Perhaps we
ought not to have supposed the syllable to be the letters; perhaps we ought
to have made it some single form produced out of them, having its own
single nature —something different from the letters.
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly; that might be more like it.
SOCRATES : We must look into the matter; we have no right to betray a
great and imposing theory in this faint-hearted manner.
THEAETETUS : Certainly not.
41. I.e., the seven vowels of ancient Greek, as contrasted with two classes of consonant:
mutes like B, which cannot be pronounced without a vowel, and semivowels like S,
which can.226 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : Then let it be as we are now suggesting. Let the complex be 204
a single form resulting from the combination of the several elements when
they ﬁt together; and let this hold both of language and of things in general.
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly.
SOCRATES : Then it must have no parts.
THEAETETUS : Why is that, now?
SOCRATES : Because when a thing has parts, the whole is necessarily all
the parts. Or do you mean by ‘the whole’ also a single form arising out
of the parts, yet different from all the parts?
THEAETETUS : I do.
SOCRATES : Now do you call ‘sum’42and ‘whole’ the same thing or differ- b
ent things?
THEAETETUS : I don’t feel at all certain; but as you keep telling me to
answer up with a good will, I will take a risk and say they are different.
SOCRATES : Your good will, Theaetetus, is all that it should be. Now we
must see if your answer is too.
THEAETETUS : We must, of course.
SOCRATES : As the argument stands at present, the whole will be different
from the sum?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Well now, is there any difference between all the things and
the sum? For instance, when we say ‘one, two, three, four, ﬁve, six’; or, c
‘twice three’,o r‘three times two’, ‘four and two’, ‘three and two and one ’;
are we speaking of the same thing in all these cases or different things?
THEAETETUS : The same thing.
SOCRATES : That is, six?
THEAETETUS : Precisely.
SOCRATES : Then with each expression have we not spoken of all the six?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : And when we speak of them all, aren’t we speaking of a sum?
THEAETETUS : We must be.
SOCRATES : That is, six?
THEAETETUS : Precisely.
SOCRATES : Then in all things made up of number, at any rate, by ‘the d
sum’ and ‘all of them’ we mean the same thing?
THEAETETUS : So it seems.
SOCRATES : Now let us talk about them in this way. The number of an
acre is the same thing as an acre, isn ’t it?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Similarly with a mile.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
42. The word translated ‘sum’ (pan) and the word translated ‘all’ (panta) in the phrase
‘all the parts ’are singular and plural forms of the same Greek word.Theaetetus 227
SOCRATES : And the number of an army is the same as the army? And
so always with things of this sort; their total number is the sum that each
of them is.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But is the number of each anything other than its parts? e
THEAETETUS : No.
SOCRATES : Now things which have parts consist of parts?
THEAETETUS : That seems true.
SOCRATES : And it is agreed that all the parts are the sum, seeing that the
total number is to be the sum.
THEAETETUS : That is so.
SOCRATES : Then the whole does not consist of parts. For if it did, it would
be all the parts and so would be a sum.
THEAETETUS : It looks as if it doesn ’t.
SOCRATES : But can a part, as such, be a part of anything but the whole?
THEAETETUS : Yes; of the sum.
SOCRATES : You are putting up a good ﬁght anyway, Theaetetus. But this 205
sum now —isn’t it just when there is nothing lacking that it is a sum?
THEAETETUS : Yes, necessarily.
SOCRATES : And won’t this very same thing —that from which nothing
anywhere is lacking —be a whole? While a thing from which something
is absent is neither a whole nor a sum —the same consequence having
followed from the same condition in both cases at once?
THEAETETUS : Well, it doesn ’t seem to me now that there can be any
difference between whole and sum.
SOCRATES : Very well. Now were we not saying43that in the case of a
thing that has parts, both the whole and the sum will be all the parts?
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly.
SOCRATES : Now come back to the thing I was trying to get at just now.44
Supposing the syllable is not just its letters, doesn ’t it follow that it cannot b
contain the letters as parts of itself? Alternatively, if it is the same as the
letters, it must be equally knowable with them?
THEAETETUS : That is so.
SOCRATES : Well, wasn ’t it just in order to avoid this result that we sup-
posed it different from the letters?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Well then, if the letters are not parts of the syllable, can you
tell me of any other things, not its letters, which are?
THEAETETUS : No, indeed. If I were to admit that it had component parts,
Socrates, it would be ridiculous, of course, to set aside the letters and look
for other components.
43. At 204a.
44. See 203d –e.228 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : Then, Theaetetus, according to our present argument, a sylla- c
ble is an absolutely single form, indivisible into parts.
THEAETETUS : It looks like it.
SOCRATES : Now, my friend, a little while ago, if you remember, we were
inclined to accept a certain proposition which we thought put the matter
very well —I mean the statement that no account can be given of the
primaries of which other things are constituted, because each of them is
in itself incomposite; and that it would be incorrect to apply even the term
‘being’ to it when we spoke of it or the term ‘this’, because these terms
signify different and alien things; and that is the reason why a primary is
an unaccountable and unknowable thing. Do you remember?
THEAETETUS : I remember.
SOCRATES : And is that the reason also why it is single in form and d
indivisible into parts or is there some other reason for that?45I can see no
other myself.
THEAETETUS : No, there really doesn ’t seem to be any other.
SOCRATES : And hasn ’t the complex now fallen into the same class as the
primary, seeing it has no parts and is a single form?
THEAETETUS : Yes, it certainly has.
SOCRATES : Well now, if the complex is both many elements and a whole,
with them as its parts, then both complexes and elements are equally
capable of being known and expressed, since all the parts turned out to
be the same thing as the whole.
THEAETETUS : Yes, surely. e
SOCRATES : But if, on the other hand, the complex is single and without
parts, then complexes and elements are equally unaccountable and un-
knowable —both of them for the same reason.
THEAETETUS : I can’t dispute that.
SOCRATES : Then if anyone tries to tell us that the complex can be known
and expressed, while the contrary is true of the element, we had better
not listen to him.
THEAETETUS : No, we’d better not, if we go along with the argument.
SOCRATES : And, more than this, wouldn ’t you more easily believe some- 206
body who made the contrary statement, because of what you know of
your own experience in learning to read and write?
THEAETETUS : What kind of thing do you mean?
SOCRATES : I mean that when you were learning you spent your time just
precisely in trying to distinguish, by both eye and ear, each individual
letter in itself so that you might not be bewildered by their different
positions in written and spoken words.
THEAETETUS : That’s perfectly true.
45. Alternatively (accepting the conjecture of tofortouto at 205d): ‘And is there any
other reason for this than that it is single in form and indivisible into parts? ’Theaetetus 229
SOCRATES : And at the music-teacher ’s, wasn’t the ﬁnished pupil the one
who would follow each note and tell to which string it belonged —the b
notes being generally admitted to be the elements in music?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s just what it amounted to.
SOCRATES : Then if the proper procedure is to take such elements and
complexes as we ourselves have experience of, and make an inference
from them to the rest, we shall say that the elements are much more clearly
known, and the knowledge of them is more decisive for the mastery of
any branch of study than knowledge of the complex. And if anyone main-
tains that the complex is by nature knowable, and the element unknowable,
we shall regard this as tomfoolery, whether it is intended to be or not.
THEAETETUS : Oh, quite.
SOCRATES : I think that might be proved in other ways too. But we mustn ’t c
let them distract us from the problem before us. We wanted to see what
can be meant by the proposition that it is in the addition of an account to
a true judgment that knowledge is perfected.
THEAETETUS : Well yes, we must try to see that.
SOCRATES : Come then, what are we intended to understand by an ‘ac-
count’? I think it must be one of three meanings.
THEAETETUS : What are they?
SOCRATES : The ﬁrst would be, making one’s thought apparent vocally d
by means of words and verbal expressions —when a man impresses an
image of his judgment upon the stream of speech, like re ﬂections upon
water or in a mirror. Don ’t you think this kind of thing is an account?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I do. At least, a man who does this is said to be giving
an account.46
SOCRATES : But isn’t that a thing that everyone is able to do more or less
readily —I mean, indicate what he thinks about a thing, if he is not deaf
or dumb to begin with? And that being so, anyone at all who makes a
correct judgment will turn out to have it ‘together with an account ’; correct e
judgment without knowledge will no longer be found anywhere.
THEAETETUS : True.
SOCRATES : Well then, we mustn’t be too ready to condemn the author
of the de ﬁnition of knowledge now before us for talking nonsense. Perhaps
he didn’t mean this; perhaps he meant being able, when questioned about 207
what a thing is, to give an answer by reference to its elements.
THEAETETUS : As for example, Socrates?
SOCRATES : As for example, what Hesiod is doing when he says, ‘One
hundred are the timbers of a wagon. ’47Now I couldn’t say what they are;
and I don’t suppose you could either. If you and I were asked what a
46.‘Giving an account’ here translates legein, the ordinary Greek word for ‘say, speak,
speak of ’, which corresponds to logos in its wider meanings ‘speech, discourse, statement ’.
47.Works and Days 456.230 Theaetetus
wagon is, we should be satisﬁed if we could answer, ‘Wheels, axle, body,
rails, yoke.’
THEAETETUS : Yes, surely.
SOCRATES : But he might think us ridiculous, just as he would if we were
asked what your name is, and replied by giving the syllables. In that case,
he would think us ridiculous because although we might be correct in our b
judgment and our expression of it, we should be fancying ourselves as
scholars, thinking we knew and were expressing a scholar’s account of
Theaetetus’ name. Whereas in fact no one gives an account of a thing with
knowledge till, in addition to his true judgment, he goes right through
the thing element by element —as I think we said before.
THEAETETUS : We did, yes.
SOCRATES : In the same way, in the example of the wagon, he would say
that we have indeed correct judgment; but it is the man who can explore c
its being by going through those hundred items who has made the addition
which adds an account to his true judgment. It is this man who has passed
from mere judgment to expert knowledge of the being of a wagon; and
he has done so in virtue of having gone over the whole by means of
the elements.
THEAETETUS : And doesn’t that seem sound to you, Socrates?
SOCRATES : Well, tell me if it seems sound to you, my friend. Tell me if
you are prepared to accept the view that an account is a matter of going
through a thing element by element, while going through it by ‘syllables’
or larger divisions falls short of being an account. Then we shall be able d
to discuss it.
THEAETETUS :I’m certainly prepared to accept that.
SOCRATES : And do you at the same time think that a man has knowledge
of anything when he believes the same thing now to be part of one thing
and now part of something else? Or when he judges that now one thing
and now something different belongs to one and the same object?
THEAETETUS : No, indeed I don’t.
SOCRATES : Then have you forgotten that at ﬁrst when you were learning
to read and write that is just what you and the other boys used to do?
THEAETETUS : You mean we used to think that sometimes one letter
and sometimes another belonged to the same syllable, and used to e
put the same letter sometimes into its proper syllable and sometimes
into another?
SOCRATES : Yes, that is what I mean.
THEAETETUS : Well, I certainly haven’t forgotten; and I don’t think people
at that stage can be said to have knowledge yet.
SOCRATES : Well, suppose now that someone who is at this sort of stage
is writing the name ‘Theaetetus’; he thinks he ought to write THE and
does so. Then suppose another time he is trying to write ‘Theodorus’, and 208
this time he thinks he should write TE and proceeds to do so. Are we
going to say that he knows the ﬁrst syllable of your names?Theaetetus 231
THEAETETUS : No. We’ve admitted that anyone who is at that stage has
not yet knowledge.
SOCRATES : And is there anything to prevent the same person being in
that situation as regards the second and third and fourth syllables?
THEAETETUS : No, nothing.
SOCRATES : Now at the time when he does this, he will be writing ‘Theaete-
tus’not only with correct judgment, but with command of the way through
its letters; that must be so whenever he writes them out one after another
in their order.
THEAETETUS : Yes, clearly.
SOCRATES : And still without knowledge though with correct judgment — b
isn’t that our view?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Yet possessing an account of it along with his correct judgment.
He was writing it, you see, with command of the way through its letters;
and we agreed that that is an account.
THEAETETUS : True.
SOCRATES : So here, my friend, we have correct judgment together with
an account, which we are not yet entitled to call knowledge.
THEAETETUS : Yes, I’m afraid that’s so.
SOCRATES : So it was only the poor man’s dream of gold that we had
when we thought we had got the truest account of knowledge. Or is it
early days to be harsh? Perhaps this is not the way in which one is to c
deﬁne ‘account’. We said that the man who deﬁnes knowledge as correct
judgment together with an account would choose one of three meanings
for‘account’. Perhaps the last is the one to deﬁne it by.
THEAETETUS : Yes, you’re right to remind me; there is one possibility still
left. The ﬁrst was, a kind of vocal image of thought; the one we have just
discussed was the way to the whole through the elements. Now what’s
your third suggestion?
SOCRATES : What the majority of people would say —namely, being able
to tell some mark by which the object you are asked about differs from
all other things.
THEAETETUS : Can you give me an example of such an ‘account’ of some-
thing?
SOCRATES : Well, take the sun, if you like. You would be satisﬁed, I d
imagine, with the answer that it is the brightest of the bodies that move
round the earth in the heavens.
THEAETETUS : Oh yes, quite.
SOCRATES : Now I want you to get hold of the principle that this illustrates.
It is what we were just saying —that if you get hold of the difference that
distinguishes a thing from everything else, then, so some people say, you
will have got an account of it. On the other hand, so long as it is some
common feature that you grasp, your account will be about all those things
which have this in common.232 Theaetetus
THEAETETUS : I see; I think it’s very good to call this kind of thing an ac- e
count.
SOCRATES : Then if a man with correct judgment about any one of the
things that are grasps in addition its difference from the rest, he has become
a knower of the thing he was a judger of before.
THEAETETUS : That’s our present position, anyway.
SOCRATES : Well, at this point, Theaetetus, as regards what we are saying,
I’m for all the world like a man looking at a shadow-painting;48when I’m
close up to it I can’t take it in in the least, though when I stood well back
from it, it appeared to me to have some meaning.
THEAETETUS : How’s that?
SOCRATES : I’ll see if I can explain. Suppose I have formed a correct 209
judgment about you; if I can grasp your account in addition, I know you,
but if not, I am merely judging you.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : And an account was to be a matter of expounding your differ-
entness?
THEAETETUS : That is so.
SOCRATES : Then when I was merely judging, my thought failed to grasp
any point of difference between you and the rest of mankind?
THEAETETUS : Apparently.
SOCRATES : What I had in mind, it seems, was some common characteris-
tic—something that belongs no more to you than to anybody else.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that must be so. b
SOCRATES : Then tell me, in Heaven’s name how, if that was so, did it
come about that you were the object of my judgment and nobody else?
Suppose my thought is that ‘This is Theaetetus—one who is a human
being, and has a nose and eyes and mouth’, and so on through the whole
list of limbs. Will this thought cause me to be thinking of Theaetetus rather
than of Theodorus, or of the proverbial ‘remotest Mysian’?
THEAETETUS : No, how could it?
SOCRATES : But suppose I think not merely of ‘the one with nose and
eyes’, but of ‘the one with a snub nose and prominent eyes’. Shall I even c
then be judging you any more than myself or anyone who is like that?
THEAETETUS : Not at all.
SOCRATES : It will not, I take it, be Theaetetus who is judged in my mind
until this snub-nosedness of yours has left imprinted and established in
me a record that is different in some way from the other snub-nosednesses
I have seen; and so with the other details of your makeup. And this
will remind me, if I meet you tomorrow, and make me judge correctly
about you.
48. The pictorial technique referred to ( skiagraphia) seems to have been one which de-
pended on contrasts between light and shade to create the appearance of form and
volume. A more familiar comparison for modern readers would be a pointilliste painting
by Seurat.Theaetetus 233
THEAETETUS : That’s perfectly true.
SOCRATES : Then correct judgment also must be concerned with the differ- d
entness of what it is about?
THEAETETUS : So it seems, anyway.
SOCRATES : Then what more might this ‘adding an account to correct
judgment’ be? If, on the one hand, it means that we must make another
judgment about the way in which a thing differs from the rest of things,
we are being required to do something very absurd.
THEAETETUS : How’s that?
SOCRATES : Because we already have a correct judgment about the way
a thing differs from other things; and we are then directed to add a correct
judgment about the way it differs from other things. At that rate, the way
a roller goes round or a pestle or anything else proverbial would be nothing e
compared with such directions; they might be more justly called a matter
of‘the blind leading the blind’. To tell us to add what we already have,
in order to come to know what we are judging about, bears a generous
resemblance to the behavior of a man benighted.
THEAETETUS : Whereas if, on the other hand, ...?49What else were you
going to suggest when you started this inquiry just now?
SOCRATES : Well, if ‘adding an account’ means that we are required to
get to know the differentness, not merely judge it, this most splendid of
our accounts of knowledge turns out to be a very amusing affair. For 210
getting to know of course is acquiring knowledge, isn ’t it?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : So, it seems, the answer to the question ‘What is knowledge?’
will be ‘Correct judgment accompanied by knowledge of the differentness’—
for this is what we are asked to understand by the ‘addition of an account. ’
THEAETETUS : Apparently so.
SOCRATES : And it is surely just silly to tell us, when we are trying to
discover what knowledge is, that it is correct judgment accompanied by
knowledge, whether of differentness or of anything else? And so, Theaetetus,
knowledge is neither perception nor true judgment, nor an account added b
to true judgment.
THEAETETUS : It seems not.
SOCRATES : Well now, dear lad, are we still pregnant, still in labor with
any thoughts about knowledge? Or have we been delivered of them all?
THEAETETUS : As far as I’m concerned, Socrates, you’ve made me say far
more than ever was in me, Heaven knows.
SOCRATES : Well then, our art of midwifery tells us that all of these off-
spring are wind-eggs and not worth bringing up?
THEAETETUS : Undoubtedly.
SOCRATES : And so, Theaetetus, if ever in the future you should attempt
to conceive or should succeed in conceiving other theories, they will be c
better ones as the result of this inquiry. And if you remain barren, your
49. Reading Ei ge de ¯...forEipe de ¯at 209e5.234 Theaetetus
companions will ﬁnd you gentler and less tiresome; you will be modest
and not think you know what you don’t know. This is all my art can
achieve —nothing more. I do not know any of the things that other men
know —the great and inspired men of today and yesterday. But this art
of midwifery my mother and I had allotted to us by God; she to deliver
women, I to deliver men that are young and generous of spirit, all that 210d
have any beauty. And now I must go to the King’s Porch to meet the
indictment that Meletus has brought against me; but let us meet here again
in the morning, Theodorus.`;

export const sophist = `The day following their conversation in Theaetetus, the geometer Theodorus,
together with his Athenian pupils Theaetetus and Socrates’ young namesake, re-
joins Socrates for further discussion. They bring with them a philosopher visit-
ing from Elea, a Greek town of Southern Italy famous as home to the great phi-
losopher Parmenides and his pupil, the logician Zeno—both of whom Socrates
had encountered in yet another dialogue closely linked to this one, Parmen-
ides. Socrates asks whether this visitor and the others at Elea treat the philoso-
pher, the statesman, and the sophist as actually being just one thing—a single
sort of person, though appearing to different people as falling under just one or
another of these headings—or rather as having three distinct intellectual capaci-
ties, as their three names indicate. Hearing that the latter is the Eleatics’ view,
he thus initiates two successive, complex discussions. First, in Sophist, the visi-
tor, opting to use Socrates’ favorite procedure of question and answer, displays
in full detail his own conception of the sophist. In Statesman he then contin-
ues in a similar way with the statesman. There is no third discussion of the
philosopher, despite occasional suggestions that the initial agenda calls for one.
The visitor, after all, isa distinguished philosopher. Perhaps Plato’s intention
is to mark the philosopher off for us from these other two through showing a
supreme philosopher at work deﬁning them and therein demonstrating his own
devotion to truth, and the correct method of analysis for achieving it: for Plato
these together deﬁne the philosopher.
In deﬁning the sophist, the visitor employs the ‘method of division’—or,
more accurately, of ‘collection and division’—described in Phaedrus 265d ff.
and early on in Philebus; this also underlies the latter’s discussion of the varie-
ties of pleasure and knowledge. He ﬁrst offers six distinct routes for under-
standing the sophist, by systematically demarcating speciﬁc classes within suc-
cessively smaller, nested, more inclusive classes of practitioners; these speciﬁc
subclasses are then identiﬁed as the sophists. Apparently ‘sophistry’ is a some-
what loosely associated set of distinct capacities—it hunts rich, prominent
young men so as to receive a wage for speaking persuasively to them about vir-
tue, it sells (in several different circumstances) items of alleged knowledge on
this same subject, it is expert at winning private debates about right and
wrong, it cleanses people’s souls by refuting their false or poorly supported
ideas. Yet in a ﬁnal accounting—whose long-delayed completion is reached
only at the very end of the dialogue—the sophist is ‘penned in’ as one who,
235236 Sophist
though aware that he does not know anything, produces in words totally inade-
quate ‘copies’ of the truth on important subjects, ones he makes appear to oth-
ers to bethe truth, even though, being false, they are hardly even like it. The
relation of this ﬁnal deﬁnition to the six ﬁrst ones is not fully explored. The vis-
itor may be intimating the general principle that sometimes a ‘nature’ or real
‘kind’ has no single place in a systematic division; it uniﬁes a set of differently
located functions, each with its own differences from its more immediate intel-
lectual neighbors. In any case, the essential idea of the ‘method of collection
and division’ is that each thing is to be understood through a full, lively aware-
ness of its similarities and differences in relation to other things —the sort of
awareness that the varied divisions encourage us to reach. Much other general
instruction on how to make proper use of the ‘method’ is given in Statesman.
The visitor delays completing his ﬁnal accounting because he sees the need
ﬁrst to show how it is even possible for anyone to do what he wants to say the
sophist does do —speak words that appear to be true but in fact are false. The
trouble is that he understands speaking falsely as saying ‘what is not’, while
his teacher Parmenides famously maintained that that is impossible: so he is re-
quired to engage in ‘parricide’—in showing how Parmenides was wrong. There
ensues an elaborate discussion of the meaning of ‘what is’ as well as of ‘what
is not’, in which we can see Plato working out a new theory of the nature of
the Form of being, and its relations to other ‘greatest’ or most comprehensive
Forms: such a theory is needed to make saying ‘what is not’—speaking
falsely —intelligible after all. Much of the interest of the dialogue has always
been found in this metaphysical excursion into the topic of being —and not be-
ing—in general.J.M.C.
THEODORUS : We’ve come at the proper time by yesterday’s agreement, 216
Socrates. We’re also bringing this man who’s visiting us. He’s from Elea
and he’s a member of the group who gather around Parmenides and Zeno.
And he’s very much a philosopher.
SOCRATES : Are you bringing a visitor, Theodorus? Or are you bringing
a god without realizing it instead, like the ones Homer mentions? He says
gods accompany people who are respectful and just.1He also says the god b
of visitors—who’s at least as much a god as any other—is a companion
who keeps an eye on people’s actions, both the criminal and the lawful
ones. So your visitor might be a greater power following along with you,
Translated by Nicholas P. White.
1. See Odyssey ix.270–71.Sophist 237
a sort of god of refutation to keep watch on us and show how bad we are
at speaking —and to refute us.
THEODORUS : That’s not our visitor’s style, Socrates. He’s more moderate
than the enthusiasts for debating are. And he doesn’t seem to me to be a
god at all. He isdivine —but then I call all philosophers that. c
SOCRATES : And that’s the right thing for you to do, my friend. But proba-
bly it’s no easier, I imagine, to distinguish that kind of person than it is
to distinguish gods. Certainly the genuine philosophers who “haunt our
cities”2—by contrast to the fake ones —take on all sorts of different appear-
ances just because of other people’s ignorance. As philosophers look down
from above at the lives of those below them, some people think they’re
worthless and others think they’re worth everything in the world. Some-
times they take on the appearance of statesmen, and sometimes of sophists. d
Sometimes, too, they might give the impression that they’re completely
insane. But if it’s all right with our visitor I’d be glad to have him tell us
what the people where he comes from used to apply the following names
to, and what they thought about these things? 217
THEODORUS : What things?
SOCRATES :Sophist, statesman, and philosopher.
THEODORUS : What, or what kind of thing, especially makes you consider
asking that question? What special problem about them do you have
in mind?
SOCRATES : This: did they think that sophists, statesmen, and philosophers
make up one kind of thing or two? Or did they divide them up into three
kinds corresponding to the three names and attach one name to each of them?
THEODORUS : I don’t think it would offend him to tell us about it. Or
would it, sir?
VISITOR : No, Theodorus, it wouldn’t offend me. I don’t have any objection. b
And the answer is easy: they think there are three kinds. Distinguishing
clearly what each of them is, though, isn’t a small or easy job.
THEODORUS : Luckily, Socrates, you’ve gotten hold of words that are very
much like the ones we happened to be asking him about. And he made
the same excuse to us that he made to you just now —since he’s heard a
lot about the issue, after all, and hasn’t forgotten it.
SOCRATES : In that case, sir, don’t refuse our very ﬁrst request. Tell us c
this. When you want to explain something to somebody, do you usually
prefer to explain it by yourself in a long speech, or to do it with questions?
That’s the way Parmenides did it one time, when he was very old and I
was young.3He used questions to generate a very ﬁne discussion.
2. See Odyssey xvii.483–87. . . . gods go from town to town disguised as visitors of
varied appearance, just like Odysseus on this occasion, to observe the deeds of just and
unjust people.
3. The reference is to the conversation in the Parmenides.238 Sophist
VISITOR :I t’s easier to do it the second way, Socrates, if you’re talking d
with someone who’s easy to handle and isn’t a trouble-maker. Otherwise
it’s easier to do it alone.
SOCRATES : You can pick anyone here you want. They’ll all answer you
politely. But if you take my advice you’ll choose one of the young ones —
Theaetetus here or for that matter any of the others you prefer.
VISITOR : As long as I’m here with you for the ﬁrst time, Socrates, I’db e
embarrassed not to make our meeting a conversational give-and-take, but e
instead to stretch things out and give a long continuous speech by myself
or even to someone else, as if I were delivering an oration. A person
wouldn’t expect the issue you just mentioned to be as small as your
question suggests. In fact it needs a very long discussion. On the other
hand, it certainly seems rude and uncivilized for a visitor not to oblige
you and these people here, especially when you’ve spoken the way you
have. So I’ll accept Theaetetus as the person to talk with, on the basis of 218
your urging, and because I’ve talked with him myself before.
THEAETETUS : Then please do that, sir, and you’ll be doing us all a favor,
just as Socrates said.
VISITOR : We probably don’t need to say anything more about that, then,
Theaetetus. From now on you’re the one I should have the rest of our talk
with. But if you’re annoyed at how long the job takes, you should blame
your friends here instead of me.
THEAETETUS : I don’t think I’ll give out now, but if anything like that does b
happen we’ll have to use this other Socrates over here as a substitute. He’s
Socrates’ namesake, but he’s my age and exercises with me and he’s used
to sharing lots of tasks with me.
VISITOR : Good. As the talk goes along you’ll think about that on your
own. But with me I think you need to begin the investigation from the
sophist —by searching for him and giving a clear account of what he is. c
Now in this case you and I only have the name in common, and maybe
we’ve each used it for a different thing. In every case, though, we always
need to be in agreement about the thing itself by means of a verbal explana-
tion, rather than doing without any such explanation and merely agreeing
about the name. But it isn’t the easiest thing in the world to grasp the
tribe we’re planning to search for —I mean, the sophist —or say what it is.
But if an important issue needs to be worked out well, then as everyone
has long thought, you need to practice on unimportant, easier issues ﬁrst. d
So that’s my advice to us now, Theaetetus: since we think it’s hard to hunt
down and deal with the kind, sophist, we ought to practice our method of
hunting on something easier ﬁrst—unless you can tell us about another
way that’s somehow more promising.
THEAETETUS : I can’t.
VISITOR : Do you want us to focus on something trivial and try to use it
as a model for the more important issue?Sophist 239
THEAETETUS : Yes. e
VISITOR : What might we propose that’s unimportant and easy to under-
stand, but can have an account given of it just as much as more important
things can? For example, an angler: isn’t that recognizable to everybody,
but not worth being too serious about?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : That, I expect, will provide an appropriate method of hunting 219
and way of talking for what we want.
THEAETETUS : That would be ﬁne.
VISITOR : Well then, let’s go after the angler from this starting point. Tell
me, shall we take him to be an expert at something, or a nonexpert with
another sort of capacity?
THEAETETUS :H e ’sd e ﬁnitely not a nonexpert.
VISITOR : But expertise as a whole falls pretty much into two types.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : There’s farming, or any sort of caring for any mortal body; and
there’s also caring for things that are put together or fabricated, which we
call equipment; and there’s imitation. The right thing would be to call all b
those things by a single name.
THEAETETUS : How? What name?
VISITOR : When you bring anything into being that wasn’t in being before,
we say you’re a producer and that the thing you’ve brought into being
is produced.
THEAETETUS : That’s right.
VISITOR : And all the things we went through just now have their own
capacity for that.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Let’s put them under the heading of production.
THEAETETUS : All right. c
VISITOR : Next, consider the whole type that has to do with learning,
recognition, commerce, combat, and hunting. None of these creates any-
thing. They take things that are or have come into being, and they take
possession of some of them with words and actions, and they keep other
things from being taken possession of. For that reason it would be appro-
priate to call all the parts of this type acquisition.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that would be appropriate.
VISITOR : If every expertise falls under acquisition or production, Theaete- d
tus, which one shall we put angling in?
THEAETETUS : Acquisition, obviously.
VISITOR : Aren’t there two types of expertise in acquisition? Is one type
mutually willing exchange, through gifts and wages and purchase? And
would the other type, which brings things into one’s possession by actions
or words, be expertise in taking possession?
THEAETETUS : It seems so, anyway, given what we’ve said.240 Sophist
VISITOR : Well then, shouldn’t we cut possession-taking in two?
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : The part that’s done openly we label combat, and the part that’s e
secret we call hunting.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And furthermore it would be unreasonable not to cut hunting
in two.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : We divide it into the hunting of living things and the hunting
of lifeless things.
THEAETETUS : Yes, if there are both kinds.
VISITOR : How could there not be? But we should let the part involving 220
lifeless things go. It doesn’t have a name, except for some kinds of diving
and other trivial things like that. The other part —namely the hunting of
living animals —we should call animal-hunting.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : And isn’t it right to say that animal-hunting has two types? One
is land-hunting, the hunting of things with feet, which is divided into
many types with many names. The other is aquatic hunting, which hunts
animals that swim.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And things that swim, we see, fall into things with wings and b
things living underwater.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And all hunting of things that have wings, I suppose, is called
bird-catching.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And all hunting of underwater things is ﬁshing.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Well then, this kind of hunting might be divided into two
main parts.
THEAETETUS : What are they?
VISITOR : One of them does its hunting with stationary nets and the other
one does it by striking.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean? How are you dividing them?
VISITOR : The ﬁrst one is whatever involves surrounding something c
and enclosing it to prevent it from escaping, so it’s reasonable to call
it enclosure.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Shouldn’t baskets, nets, slipknots, creels, and so forth be
called enclosures?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR :S ow e ’ll call this part of hunting enclosure-hunting or something
like that.Sophist 241
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : But the kind that’s done by striking with hooks or three-pronged
spears is different, and we should call it by one word, strike-hunting. Or d
what term would be better?
THEAETETUS : Let’s not worry about the name. That one will do.
VISITOR : Then there’s a part of striking that’s done at night by
ﬁrelight, and as it happens is called torch-hunting by the people who
do it.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But the whole daytime part is called hooking, since even the
three-pronged spears have hooks on their points.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s what it’s called. e
VISITOR : Then one part of the hooking part of striking is done by striking
downward from above. And since you usually use a three-pronged spear
that way, I think it’s called spearing.
THEAETETUS : Some people do call it that.
VISITOR : And I suppose there’s only one type left.
THEAETETUS : What?
VISITOR :I t’s the type of striking contrary to the previous one. It’s done
with a hook, not to just any part of the ﬁsh’s body but always to the prey’s 221
head and mouth, and pulls it upward from below with rods or reeds.
What are we going to say its name should be, Theaetetus?
THEAETETUS : I think we’ve now found what we said we aimed to ﬁnd.
VISITOR : So now we’re in agreement about the angler’s expertise, not b
just as to its name; in addition we’ve also sufﬁciently grasped a verbal
explanation concerning the thing itself. Within expertise as a whole one
half was acquisitive; half of the acquisitive was taking possession; half of
possession-taking was hunting; half of hunting was animal-hunting; half
of animal-hunting was aquatic hunting; all of the lower portion of aquatic
hunting was ﬁshing; half of ﬁshing was hunting by striking; and half of
striking was hooking. And the part of hooking that involves a blow drawing
a thing upward from underneath is called by a name that’s derived by its c
similarity to the action itself, that is, it’s called draw-ﬁshing or angling —
which is what we’re searching for.
THEAETETUS :W e ’ve got a completely adequate demonstration of that,
anyway.
VISITOR : Well then, let’s use that model to try and ﬁnd the sophist, and
see what he is.
THEAETETUS : Fine.
VISITOR : The ﬁrst question, then, was whether we should suppose the
angler is a nonexpert, or that he’s an expert at something?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Well, shall we suppose the sophist is a layman, or completely d
and truly an expert?242 Sophist
THEAETETUS :H e’s not a layman at all. I understand what you’re saying:
he has to be the kind of person that the name sophist indicates.4
VISITOR : So it seems we need to take him to have a kind of expertise.
THEAETETUS : But what is it?
VISITOR : For heaven’s sake, don’t we recognize that the one man belongs
to the same kind as the other?
THEAETETUS : Which men?
VISITOR : The angler and the sophist.
THEAETETUS : In what way?
VISITOR : To me they both clearly appear to be hunters.
THEAETETUS : We said which kind of hunting the angler does. What kind e
does the sophist do?
VISITOR : We divided all hunting into two parts, one for land animals
and one for swimming animals.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : We went through one part, about the animals that swim under-
water. But we left the land part undivided, though we noted that it contains
many types.
THEAETETUS : Of course. 222
VISITOR : Up till that point the sophist and the angler go the same way,
beginning from expertise in acquisition.
THEAETETUS : They seem to, anyway.
VISITOR : Starting from animal hunting, though, they turn away from
each other. One goes to ponds, rivers, and the sea, and hunts for the
animals there.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : The other one goes to the land and to different kinds of rivers,
which are like plentiful meadows of wealthy youths, to take possession
of the things living there.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean? b
VISITOR : There are two main kinds of things to hunt on land.
THEAETETUS : What are they?
VISITOR : Tame things and wild ones.
THEAETETUS : Is there any such thing as hunting tame animals?
VISITOR : There is if human beings are tame animals, at any rate. Make
whichever assumption you like: either there are no tame animals, or there
are tame animals but humans are wild, or else, you’ll say, humans are
tame but aren’t hunted. Specify whichever you prefer to say.
THEAETETUS : I think we’re tame animals and I’ll say that humans are in c
fact hunted.
4. The word “sophist” (sophiste ¯s) is etymologically related to the word “wise” (sophos),
and so can be taken to connote knowledge and expertise.Sophist 243
VISITOR : Then let’s say that the hunting of tame animals falls into two
parts.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : Let’s take piracy, enslavement, tyranny, along with everything
that has to do with war, and let’sd e ﬁne them all together as hunting
by force.
THEAETETUS : Fine.
VISITOR : And we’ll also take legal oratory, political oratory, and conversa-
tion all together in one whole, and call them all one single sort of expertise, d
expertise in persuasion.
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : Let’s say that there are two kinds of persuasion.
THEAETETUS : What are they?
VISITOR : One is done privately, and the other is done in public.
THEAETETUS : Yes, each of those is one type.
VISITOR : And doesn’t one part of private hunting earn wages, while the
other part gives gifts?
THEAETETUS : I don’t understand.
VISITOR : It seems you aren’t paying attention to the way lovers hunt.
THEAETETUS : In what connection?
VISITOR : The fact that when they hunt people they give presents to e
them too.
THEAETETUS : Very true.
VISITOR : Let’s call this type expertise in love.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : One part of the wage-earning type approaches people by being
agreeable, uses only pleasure as its bait, and earns only its own room and
board. I think we’d all call it ﬂattery, or expertise in pleasing people. 223
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But doesn’t the kind of wage-earning that actually earns money,
though it claims to deal with people for the sake of virtue, deserve to be
called by a different name?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : What name? Try and tell me.
THEAETETUS :I t’s obvious. I think we’ve found the sophist. I think that’s
the name that would be suitable for him.
VISITOR : So according to our account now, Theaetetus, it seems that this b
sort of expertise belongs to appropriation, taking possession, hunting,
animal-hunting, hunting on land, human hunting, hunting by persuasion,
hunting privately, and money-earning.5It’s the hunting of rich, prominent
young men. And according to the way our account has turned out, it’s
what should be called the expertise of the sophist.
5. In addition to the words bracketed by Burnet, we bracket doxopaideutike ¯salso.244 Sophist
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : Still, let’s look at it this way too, since what we’re looking for c
isn’t a trivial sort of expertise but quite a diverse one. And even in what
we’ve just said earlier it actually presents the appearance of being not
what we’re now saying, but a different type.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : Expertise in acquisition had two parts, hunting and exchanging.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And let’s say there are two types of exchanging, giving and
selling.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : And we’re also going to say that selling divides in two.
THEAETETUS : How? d
VISITOR : One part is the sale of things that the seller himself makes. The
other is purveying, that is, the purveying of things other people make.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Then what? Isn’t the part of purveying that’s done within the
city—about half of it —called retailing?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And isn’t wholesaling the part that buys and sells things for
exchange between one city and another?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And can’t we see that one part of wholesaling sells things for e
the nourishment and use of the body in exchange for cash, and the other
sells things for the soul?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean by that?
VISITOR : Maybe we don’t understand the one for the soul —since certainly
we understand the other kind.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Let’s consider every kind of music that’s carried from one city 224
to another and bought here and sold there, as well as painting and shows
and other things for the soul. Some of them are transported and sold for
amusement and others for serious purposes. We can use the word wholesaler
for the transporter and seller of these things just as well as for someone
who sells food and beverages.
THEAETETUS : That’s absolutely true.
VISITOR : Wouldn’t you use the same name for somebody who bought b
and exchanged items of knowledge for money from city to city?
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.
VISITOR : Wouldn’t the right thing to say be that the art of display is one
part of that soul-wholesaling? And don’t we have to call the other part of
it, the part that consists in selling knowledge, by a name that’s similar and
also equally ridiculous?
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.VISITOR: And one name should be used for the part of this knowledge-  
selling that deals with knowledge of virtue, and another name for the part  
that deals with knowledge of other things?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR: “Expertise-selling” would fit the second one. You try and tell  
me the name of the first one.
THEAETETUS : What other name could you mention that would fit, except  
for the kind, sophist, which we’re looking for right now?
VISITOR: I couldn’t mention any other one. Come on now and let’s collect it  
all together. We’ll say that the expertise of the part of acquisition, exchange,  
selling, wholesaling, and soul-wholesaling, dealing in words and learning  
that have to do with virtue—that’s sophistry in its second appearance.
THEAETETUS : Definitely.
VISITOR: In the third place I think you’d call somebody just the same  
thing if he settled here in the city and undertook to make his living selling  
those same things, both ones that he’d bought and ones that he’d made  
himself.
THEAETETUS : Yes, I would.
VISITOR: So apparently you’ll still say that sophistry falls under acquisi -
tion, exchange, and selling, either by retailing things that others make or by 
selling things that he makes himself. It’s the retail sale of any learning that 
has to do with the sorts of things we mentioned.
THEAETETUS : It has to be, since we need to stay consistent with what we 
said before.
VISITOR: Now let’s see whether the type we’re chasing is something like 
the following.
THEAETETUS : What? 
VISITOR: Combat was one part of acquisition.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR: And it makes sense to divide it in two.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR: We’ll take one part to be competition and the other part to be  
fighting.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR: And it would be fitting and proper to give a name like violence to  
the part of fighting in which one body fights against another.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR: And as for the part that pits words against words, what else 
would you call it other than controversy?
THEAETETUS : Nothing else.
VISITOR: But we have to have two types of controversy.T HEAETETUS : In 
what way?
VISITOR: So far as it involves one long public speech directed against  
another and deals with justice and injustice, it’s forensic.
THEAETETUS : Yes.Sophist  245
c
d
e
225
bVISITOR: But if it goes on in private discussions and is chopped up into  
questions and answers, don’t we usually call it disputation?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR: One part of disputation involves controversy about contracts  
and isn’t carried on in any systematic or expert way. We should take that  
to be a type of disputation, since we can express what makes it different.  
But it hasn’t been given a name before and it doesn’t deserve to get one 
from us.
THEAETETUS : That’s true. Its subtypes are too small and varied.
VISITOR: But what about disputation that’s done expertly and involves  
controversy about general issues, including what’s just and what’s unjust? 
Don’t we normally call that debating?6
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR: Part of debating, it turns out, wastes money and the other  
part makes money.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR: Let’s try and say what each of them ought to be called.
THEAETETUS : We have to.
VISITOR: I think one type of debating is a result of the pleasure a person  
gets from the activity, and involves neglecting his own livelihood. But its  
style is unpleasant to most people who hear it, and in my view it’s right to  
call it chatter.
THEAETETUS : That’s pretty much what people do call it.
VISITOR: You take a turn now. Say what its contrary is, which makes  
money from debates between individuals.
THEAETETUS : How could anyone go wrong in saying that the amazing  
sophist we’ve been after has turned up once again for the fourth time.
VISITOR: It seems his type is precisely the money-making branch of ex -
pertise in debating, disputation, controversy, fighting, combat, and acquisi-
tion. According to what our account shows us now, that’s the sophist.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR: So you see how true it is that the beast is complex and can’t be 
caught with one hand, as they say.
THEAETETUS : It does take both hands.
VISITOR: Yes, and you need all your capacity to follow his tracks in what’s 
to come. Tell me: don’t we call some things by names that houseservants 
use?
THEAETETUS : A lot of things. But what are you asking about?
VISITOR: For example things like filtering, straining, winnowing.
6. The word here translated by “debating,” eristikon, is sometimes translated (or trans-
literated) “eristic.” It refers to a practice of competitive debating which the sophists made 
popular in Athens. Plato’s use of the term stigmatizes the practice as not directed at truth.246 Sophist

bSophist 247
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And also we know about carding, spinning, weaving, and a
million other things like that which are involved in experts’ crafts. Is
that right?
THEAETETUS : What general point are you trying to make with these ex- c
amples?
VISITOR : All the things I’ve mentioned are kinds of dividing.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Since there’s a single kind of expertise involved in all of them,
then according to what I’ve said we’ll expect it to have a single name.
THEAETETUS : What shall we call it?
VISITOR : Discrimination.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : Think about whether we can see two types in it.
THEAETETUS : You’re asking me to do some quick thinking.
VISITOR : In fact in what we’ve called discriminations one kind separates d
what’s worse from what’s better and the other separates like from like.
THEAETETUS : That’s obvious —now that you’ve said it.
VISITOR : I don’t have an ordinary name for one of them, but I do have
a name for the kind of discrimination that leaves what’s better and throws
away what’s worse.
THEAETETUS : What? Tell me.
VISITOR : I think everyone says that that kind of discrimination is
cleansing.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Won’t everyone see that cleansing has two types? e
THEAETETUS : Yes, maybe, if they had time, but I don’t see now.
VISITOR : Many kinds of cleansing that have to do with the body can
appropriately be included under a simple name.
THEAETETUS : Which ones? What name?
VISITOR : There’s the cleansing of the inside part of living bodies, which
is done by gymnastics and medicine. And there’s the cleansing of the 227
insigniﬁcant outside part that’s done by bathing. And also there’s the
cleansing of nonliving bodies, which fulling and all kinds of furbishing take
care of and which have lots of specialized and ridiculous-seeming names.
THEAETETUS : Very ridiculous.
VISITOR : Of course, Theaetetus. But our method of dealing with words
doesn’t care one way or the other whether cleansing by sponging or by
taking medicine does a lot of good or only a little. The method aims at
acquiring intelligence, so it tries to understand how all kinds of expertise b
belong to the same kind or not. And so for that it values them all equally
without thinking that some of them are more ridiculous than others, as
far as their similarity is concerned. And it doesn’t consider a person more
impressive because he exempliﬁes hunting by military expertise rather248 Sophist
than by picking lice. Instead it usually considers him more vapid. Moreover
you just asked about what name we call all the capacities that are assigned
to living or nonliving bodies. As far as that’s concerned, it doesn’t matter c
to our method which name would seem to be the most appropriate, just
so long as it keeps the cleansing of the soul separate from the cleansing
of everything else. For the time being, the method has only tried to distin-
guish the cleansing that concerns thinking from the other kinds —if, that
is, we understand what its aim is.
THEAETETUS : I do understand, and I agree that there are two types of
cleansing, one dealing with the soul and a separate one dealing with
the body.
VISITOR : Fine. Next listen and try to cut the one we’ve mentioned in two.
THEAETETUS :I’ll try to follow your lead and cut it however you say. d
VISITOR : Do we say that wickedness in the soul is something different
from virtue?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And to cleanse something was to leave what’s good and throw
out whatever’s inferior.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So insofar as we can ﬁnd some way to remove what’s bad in
the soul, it will be suitable to call it cleansing.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : We have to say that there are two kinds of badness that affect
the soul.
THEAETETUS : What are they?
VISITOR : One is like bodily sickness, and the other is like ugliness. 228
THEAETETUS : I don’t understand.
VISITOR : Presumably you regard sickness and discord as the same thing,
don’t you?
THEAETETUS : I don’t know what I should say to that.
VISITOR : Do you think that discord is just dissension among things that
are naturally of the same kind, and arises out of some kind of corruption?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And ugliness is precisely a consistently unattractive sort of
disproportion?
THEAETETUS : Yes. b
VISITOR : Well then, don’t we see that there’s dissension in the souls of
people in poor condition, between beliefs and desires, anger and pleasures,
reason and pains, and all of those things with each other?
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : But all of them do have to be akin to each other.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR :S ow e ’d be right if we said that wickedness is discord and
sickness of the soul.Sophist 249
THEAETETUS : Absolutely right.
VISITOR : Well then, suppose something that’s in motion aims at a target c
and tries to hit it, but on every try passes by it and misses. Are we going
to say that it does this because it’s properly proportioned or because it’s
out of proportion?
THEAETETUS : Out of proportion, obviously.
VISITOR : But we know that no soul is willingly ignorant of anything.
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.
VISITOR : But ignorance occurs precisely when a soul tries for the truth, d
but swerves aside from understanding and so is beside itself.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : So we have to take it that an ignorant soul is ugly and out
of proportion.
THEAETETUS : It seems so.
VISITOR : Then there are, it appears, these two kinds of badness in the
soul. Most people call one of them wickedness, but it’s obviously a disease
of the soul.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : They call the other one ignorance, but if it occurs only in a
person’s soul they aren’t willing to agree that it’s a form of badness.
THEAETETUS : One thing absolutely must be granted —the point I was in e
doubt about when you made it just now —that there are two kinds of
deﬁciency in the soul. We need to say that cowardice, licentiousness, and
injustice are a disease in us, and that to be extremely ignorant of all sorts
of things is a kind of ugliness.
VISITOR : In the case of the body, weren’t there two kinds of expertise
dealing with those two conditions?
THEAETETUS : What were they?
VISITOR : Gymnastics for ugliness and medicine for sickness. 229
THEAETETUS : Apparently.
VISITOR : And isn’t correction the most appropriate of all kinds of expertise
for treating insolence, injustice, and cowardice?7
THEAETETUS : So it seems, to judge by what people think.
VISITOR : Well then, for all kinds of ignorance wouldn’t teaching be the
right treatment to mention?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Now should we say that there’s only one kind of expertise in b
teaching or more than one, with two of them being the most important
ones? Think about it.
THEAETETUS : I am.
VISITOR : I think we’ll ﬁnd it quickest this way.
THEAETETUS : How?
7. The text seems faulty here. The general sense, however, is clear.250 Sophist
VISITOR : By seeing whether ignorance has a cut down the middle of it.
If it has two parts, that will force teaching to have two parts too, one for
each of the parts of ignorance.
THEAETETUS : Well, do you see what we’re looking for?
VISITOR : I think I see a large, difﬁcult type of ignorance marked off from c
the others and overshadowing all of them.
THEAETETUS : What’s it like?
VISITOR : Not knowing, but thinking that you know. That’s what probably
causes all the mistakes we make when we think.
THEAETETUS : That’s true.
VISITOR : And furthermore it’s the only kind of ignorance that’s called
lack of learning.
THEAETETUS : Certainly.
VISITOR : Well then, what should we call the part of teaching that gets
rid of it?
THEAETETUS : The other part consists in the teaching of crafts, I think, but d
here in Athens we call this one education.
VISITOR : And just about all other Greeks do too, Theaetetus. But we still
have to think about whether education is indivisible or has divisions that
are worth mentioning.
THEAETETUS : We do have to think about that.
VISITOR : I think it can be cut somehow.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : One part of the kind of teaching that’s done in words is a rough e
road, and the other part is smoother.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean by these two parts?
VISITOR : One of them is our forefathers’ time-honored method of scolding
or gently encouraging. They used to employ it especially on their sons,
and many still use it on them nowadays when they do something wrong. 230
Admonition would be the right thing to call all of this.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : As for the other part, some people seem to have an argument
to give to themselves that lack of learning is always involuntary, and that
if someone thinks he’s wise, he’ll never be willing to learn anything about
what he thinks he’s clever at. These people think that though admonition
is a lot of work, it doesn’t do much good.
THEAETETUS : They’re right about that.
VISITOR : So they set out to get rid of the belief in one’s own wisdom in b
another way.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : They cross-examine someone when he thinks he’s saying some-
thing though he’s saying nothing. Then, since his opinions will vary incon-
sistently, these people will easily scrutinize them. They collect his opinions
together during the discussion, put them side by side, and show that theySophist 251
conﬂict with each other at the same time on the same subjects in relation
to the same things and in the same respects. The people who are being
examined see this, get angry at themselves, and become calmer toward
others. They lose their inﬂated and rigid beliefs about themselves that c
way, and no loss is pleasanter to hear or has a more lasting effect on them.
Doctors who work on the body think it can’t beneﬁt from any food that’s
offered to it until what’s interfering with it from inside is removed. The
people who cleanse the soul, my young friend, likewise think the soul,
too, won’t get any advantage from any learning that’s offered to it until d
someone shames it by refuting it, removes the opinions that interfere with
learning, and exhibits it cleansed, believing that it knows only those things
that it does know, and nothing more.
THEAETETUS : That’s the best and most healthy-minded way to be.
VISITOR : For all these reasons, Theaetetus, we have to say that refutation
is the principal and most important kind of cleansing. Conversely we have
to think that even the king of Persia, if he remains unrefuted, is uncleansed e
in the most important respect. He’s also uneducated and ugly, in just the
ways that anyone who is going to be really happy has to be completely
clean and beautiful.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : Well then, who are we going to say the people who apply this
form of expertise are? I’m afraid to call them sophists. 231
THEAETETUS : Why?
VISITOR :S ow ed o n ’t pay sophists too high an honor.
THEAETETUS : But there’s a similarity between a sophist and what we’ve
been talking about.
VISITOR : And between a wolf and a dog, the wildest thing there is and
the gentlest. If you’re going to be safe, you have to be especially careful
about similarities, since the type we’re talking about is very slippery.
Anyway, let that description of them stand. I certainly don’t think that
when the sophists are enough on their guard the dispute will be about an
unimportant distinction. b
THEAETETUS : That seems right.
VISITOR : So let it be the cleansing part of the expertise of discriminating
things; and let it be marked off as the part of that which concerns souls;
and within that it’s teaching; and within teaching it’s education. And let’s
say that within education, according to the way the discussion has turned
now, the refutation of the empty belief in one’s own wisdom is nothing
other than our noble sophistry.
THEAETETUS : Let’s say that. But the sophist has appeared in lots of differ-
ent ways. So I’m confused about what expression or assertion could convey c
the truth about what he really is.
VISITOR : You’re right to be confused. But we have to think that he’s
extremely confused, too, about where he can go to escape from our account252 Sophist
of him. The saying that you can’t escape all your pursuers is right. So now
we really have to go after him.
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : But let’s stop ﬁrst and catch our breath, so to speak. And while
we’re resting let’s ask ourselves, “Now, how many different appearances d
has the sophist presented to us?” I think we ﬁrst discovered him as a hired
hunter of rich young men.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Second, as a wholesaler of learning about the soul.
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : Third, didn’t he appear as a retailer of the same things?
THEAETETUS : Yes, and fourth as a seller of his own learning?
VISITOR : Your memory’s correct. I’ll try to recall the ﬁfth way: he was
an athlete in verbal combat, distinguished by his expertise in debating. e
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : The sixth appearance was disputed, but still we made a conces-
sion to him and took it that he cleanses the soul of beliefs that interfere
with learning.
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.
VISITOR : Well then, suppose people apply the name of a single sort of 232
expertise to someone, but he appears to have expert knowledge of lots of
things. In a case like that don’t you notice that something’s wrong with
the way he appears? Isn’t it obvious that if somebody takes him to be an
expert at many things, then that observer can’t be seeing clearly what it
is in his expertise that all of those many pieces of learning focus on —
which is why he calls him by many names instead of one?
THEAETETUS : That deﬁnitely does seem to be the nature of the case.
VISITOR :S ol e t ’s not let laziness make that happen to us. First let’s take b
up one of the things we said about the sophist before, which seemed to
me to exhibit him especially clearly.
THEAETETUS : What is it?
VISITOR : We said that he engages in disputes, didn’t we?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And also that he teaches other people to do the same thing
too?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Then let’s think: what subject do people like him claim to make
others able to engage in disputes about? Let’s start with something like
this: do sophists make people competent to dispute about issues about the c
gods, which are opaque to most people?
THEAETETUS : Well, people say they do.
VISITOR : And also things that are open to view, on the earth and in the
sky, and related matters?
THEAETETUS : Of course.Sophist 253
VISITOR : And when people make general statements in private discus-
sions about being and coming-to-be, we know that sophists are clever
at contradicting them and they also make other people able to do the
same thing?
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : And what about laws and all kinds of political issues? Don’t d
sophists promise to make people capable of engaging in controversies
about them?
THEAETETUS : If they didn’t promise that, practically no one would bother
to discuss anything with them.
VISITOR : As a matter of fact you can ﬁnd anything you need to say to
contradict any expert himself, both in general and within each particular
ﬁeld, laid out published and written down for anybody who wants to
learn it.
THEAETETUS : Apparently you’re talking about Protagoras’ writings on
wrestling and other ﬁelds of expertise. e
VISITOR : And on many other things, too, my friend. In fact, take expertise
in disputation as a whole. Doesn’t it seem like a capacity that’s sufﬁcient
for carrying on controversies about absolutely everything?
THEAETETUS : It doesn’t seem to leave much of anything out, anyway.
VISITOR : But for heaven’s sake, my boy, do you think that’s possible? Or
maybe you young people see into this issue more keenly than we do.
THEAETETUS : Into what? What are you getting at? I don’t fully understand 233
what you’re asking.
VISITOR : Whether it’s possible for any human being to know everything.
THEAETETUS : If it were, sir, we’d be very well off.
VISITOR : But how could someone who didn’t know about a subject make
a sound objection against someone who knew about it?
THEAETETUS : He couldn’t.
VISITOR : Then what is it in the sophist’s capacity that’s so amazing?
THEAETETUS : About what?
VISITOR : How the sophists can ever make young people believe they’re b
wiser than everyone else about everything. It’s obvious that they didn’t
make correct objections against anyone, or didn’t appear so to young
people. Or if they did appear to make correct objections, but their controver-
sies didn’t make them look any the wiser for it, then —just as you say —
people would hardly be willing to pay them money to become their stu-
dents.
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : But people are willing to?
THEAETETUS : They certainly are.
VISITOR : Since sophists do seem, I think, to know about the things they c
dispute about.
THEAETETUS : Of course.254 Sophist
VISITOR : And they do it, we say, about every subject?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So to their students they appear wise about everything?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But without actually being wise —since that appeared impos-
sible.
THEAETETUS : Of course it’s impossible.
VISITOR : So the sophist has now appeared as having a kind of belief-
knowledge about everything, but not truth.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely. What you’ve said about them is probably just d
right.
VISITOR : But let’s consider a pattern that will exhibit them more clearly.
THEAETETUS : What pattern is that?
VISITOR : This one. Pay attention to me, and try to do a good job of
answering my questions.
THEAETETUS : Which questions?
VISITOR : If someone claimed that by a single kind of expertise he could
know, not just how to say things or to contradict people, but how to make
and do everything, then . . .
THEAETETUS : What do you mean, everything? e
VISITOR : You don’t understand the ﬁrst thing I say! Seemingly you don’t
understand everything!
THEAETETUS : No, I don’t.
VISITOR : Well, I mean everything to include you and me and also the
other animals and plants . . .
THEAETETUS : What are you talking about?
VISITOR : If someone claimed that he’d make you and me and all the
other living things . . .
THEAETETUS : What kind of making are you talking about? You’re not 234
talking about some kind of gardener —after all, you did say he made an-
imals.
VISITOR : Yes, and also I mean the sea and earth and heaven and gods
and everything else. And furthermore he makes them each quickly and
sells them at a low price.
THEAETETUS : You’re talking about some kind of game for schoolchildren.
VISITOR : Well, if someone says he knows everything and would teach it
to someone else cheaply and quickly, shouldn’t we think it’s a game?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Do you know of any game that involves more expertise than b
imitation does, and is more engaging?
THEAETETUS : No, not at all, since you’ve collected everything together
and designated a very broad, extremely diverse type.
VISITOR : So think about the man who promises he can make everything
by means of a single kind of expertise. Suppose that by being expert atSophist 255
drawing he produces things that have the same names as real things. Then
we know that when he shows his drawings from far away he’ll be able
to fool the more mindless young children into thinking that he can actually
produce anything he wants to.
THEAETETUS : Of course. c
VISITOR : Well then, won’t we expect that there’s another kind of exper-
tise—this time having to do with words —and that someone can use it to
trick young people when they stand even farther away from the truth
about things? Wouldn’t he do it by putting words in their ears, and by
showing them spoken copies of everything, so as to make them believe
that the words are true and that the person who’s speaking to them is the
wisest person there is?
THEAETETUS : Yes, why shouldn’t there be that kind of expertise too? d
VISITOR : So, Theaetetus, suppose enough time has passed and the soph-
ist’s hearers have gotten older, and that they approach closer to real things
and are forced by their experiences to touch up palpably against them.
Won’t most of them inevitably change their earlier beliefs, which made
large things appear small and easy things appear hard? And won’t the
facts they’ve encountered in the course of their actions completely overturn e
all the appearances that had come to them in the form of words?
THEAETETUS : Yes —at least as far as what someone my age can tell. But
I think I’m one of the young people who are still standing far away from
real things.
VISITOR : That’s why all of us here will keep trying to take you as close
to them as possible, but without your needing those experiences to force
you. But tell me about the sophist. Is it obvious by now that he ’s a kind
of cheat who imitates real things? Or are we still in any doubt about 235
whether he truly knows all the things that he seems to be able to engage
in controversies about?
THEAETETUS : But, sir, how could we be in any doubt? By this time it’s
pretty obvious from what we’ve said that he’s one of those people who
play games.
VISITOR : So we have to regard him as a cheat and an imitator.
THEAETETUS : How could we avoid it?
VISITOR : Well, now it’s our job not to let the beast escape. We’ve
almost hemmed him in with one of those net-like devices that words b
provide for things like this. So anyway he won’t get away from this
next point.
THEAETETUS : What is it?
VISITOR : From being taken to be a kind of magician.
THEAETETUS : That’s what he seems to me to be too.
VISITOR :S oi t ’s settled. We’ll divide the craft of copy-making as quickly
as we can and we’ll go down into it. Then if the sophist gives up right
away we’ll obey the royal command and we’ll capture him and hand our c256 Sophist
catch over to the king. But if the sophist slips down somewhere into the
parts of the craft of imitation, we’ll follow along with him and we’ll divide
each of the parts that contain him until we catch him. Anyway, neither
he nor any other kind will ever be able to boast that he’s escaped from
the method of people who are able to chase a thing through both the
particular and the general.
THEAETETUS : Good. That’s how we have to do it.
VISITOR : Going by the method of division that we’ve used so far, I think
I see two types of imitation here too. But I don’t think I can clearly tell d
yet which one the type or form we’re looking for is in.
THEAETETUS : Well, ﬁrst tell us what distinction you mean.
VISITOR : One type of imitation I see is the art of likeness-making. That’s
the one we have whenever someone produces an imitation by keeping to
the proportions of length, breadth, and depth of his model, and also by e
keeping to the appropriate colors of its parts.
THEAETETUS : But don’t all imitators try to do that?
VISITOR : Not the ones who sculpt or draw very large works. If they
reproduced the true proportions of their beautiful subjects, you see, the
upper parts would appear smaller than they should, and the lower parts 236
would appear larger, because we see the upper parts from farther away
and the lower parts from closer.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR :S od o n ’t those craftsmen say goodbye to truth, and produce
in their images the proportions that seem to be beautiful instead of the
real ones?
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : So can’t the ﬁrst sort of image be called a likeness, since it’s like
the thing?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And as we said before, the part of imitation that deals with that b
should be called likeness-making.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Now, what are we going to call something that appears to be
like a beautiful thing, but only because it’s seen from a viewpoint that’s
not beautiful, and would seem unlike the thing it claims to be like if you
came to be able to see such large things adequately? If it appears the way
the thing does but in fact isn’t like it, isn’t it an appearance?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And this part of imitation covers a great deal of painting and c
of the rest of imitation.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Wouldn’t appearance-making be the right thing to call expertise
in producing appearances that aren’t likenesses?
THEAETETUS : Yes, deﬁnitely.Sophist 257
VISITOR : Well, these are the two types of copy-making I meant, likeness-
making and appearance-making.
THEAETETUS : You were right about that.
VISITOR : But still I can’t see clearly the thing I was in doubt about then,
namely, which type we should put the sophist in. He’s really an amazing
man —very hard to make out. He’s still escaped neatly into an impossibly d
confusing type to search through.
THEAETETUS : It seems that way.
VISITOR : Are you agreeing with me because you know that, or is the
current dragging you, so to speak, into agreement so quickly because the
discussion has given you a habit of agreeing?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean? Why do you say that?
VISITOR : Really, my young friend, this is a very difﬁcult investigation
we’re engaged in. This appearing, and this seeming but not being, and e
this saying things but not true things —all these issues are full of confusion,
just as they always have been. It’s extremely hard, Theaetetus, to say what
form of speech we should use to say that there really is such a thing as
false saying or believing, and moreover to utter this without being caught 237
in a verbal conﬂict.
THEAETETUS : Why?
VISITOR : Because this form of speech of ours involves the rash assumption
that that which is not is, since otherwise falsity wouldn’t come into being.
But when we were boys, my boy, the great Parmenides testiﬁed to us from
start to ﬁnish, speaking in both prose and poetic rhythms, that
Never shall this force itself on us, that that which is not may be;
While you search, keep your thought far away from this path.8
So we have his testimony to this. And our own way of speaking itself b
would make the point especially obvious if it we examined it a little. So
if it’s all the same to you, let’s look at that ﬁrst.
THEAETETUS : As far as I’m concerned you can do what you want. But as
far as our way of speaking is concerned, think about how it will go best,
and follow along with it and take me along the road with you.
VISITOR : That’s what we have to do. Tell me: do we dare to utter the
sound that which in no way is?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But suppose one of our listeners weren’t debating or playing a
game but had to think seriously and answer the following question: What c
should the name, that which is not, be applied to? Why do we think he’d
8. See Parmenides, frg. 7, ll.1 –2. The same lines reoccur, with one slight textual differ-
ence, at 258d.258 Sophist
use it, and in what connection, and for what kind of purpose? And what
would he indicate by it to someone else who wanted to ﬁnd out about it?
THEAETETUS : That’s a hard question. In fact, it’s just about completely,
impossibly confusing for someone like me to answer.
VISITOR : But anyway this much is obvious to us, that that which is not
can’t be applied to any of those which are.
THEAETETUS : Of course not.
VISITOR : So if you can’t apply it to that which is, it wouldn’t be right
either to apply it to something.
THEAETETUS : Why not?
VISITOR :I t’s obvious to us that we always apply this something to a being, d
since it’s impossible to say it by itself, as if it were naked and isolated
from all beings. Isn’t that right?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Are you agreeing because you’re thinking that a person who
says something has to be saying some onething?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Since you’d say that something is a sign of one, and that a couple
of things is a sign of two, and somethings is a sign of a plurality?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And it’s absolutely necessary, it seems, that someone who does e
not say something says nothing9at all.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Therefore don’t we have to refuse to admit that a person like
that speaks but says nothing? Instead, don’t we have to deny that anyone
who tries to utter that which is not is even speaking?
THEAETETUS : Then our way of speaking would have reached the height
of confusion.
VISITOR : Don’t do any boasting yet. There are still more confusions to 238
come, including the primary and most fundamental one, which actually
happens to be at the source of the whole problem.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean? Don’t hold back. Tell me.
VISITOR : To that which is there might belong some other of those
which are.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But shall we say that any of those which are can ever belong
to that which is not?
THEAETETUS : How could they?
VISITOR : Now then, we take all the numbers to be beings.
THEAETETUS : Yes, if we take anything else to be. b
VISITOR : Then let’s not even try to apply either plurality of number or
one to that which is not.
9. Note that the Greek word for “nothing,” me¯den, literally means something like “not
even one” (me¯de hen).Sophist 259
THEAETETUS : Our way of speaking itself tells us that it would be wrong
to try to.
VISITOR : Then how would anyone try either to say those which are not or
that which is not out loud, or even grasp them in thought, apart from
number?
THEAETETUS : Tell me.
VISITOR : Whenever we speak of those which are not, aren’t we trying to c
apply numerical plurality to them?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And when we speak of that which is not aren’t we applying one
to it?
THEAETETUS : Obviously.
VISITOR : But we say it isn’t either right or correct to try to attach that
which is to that which is not.
THEAETETUS : That’s absolutely true.
VISITOR : Do you understand, then, that it’s impossible to say, speak, or
think that which is not itself correctly by itself? It’s unthinkable, unsayable,
unutterable, and unformulable in speech.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : So was I wrong just now when I said that I would formulate d
the biggest confusion about it, when we have this other one to state which
is even bigger?
THEAETETUS : What is it?
VISITOR : My good young friend, don’t you notice on the basis of the
things we said that that which is not even confuses the person who’s refuting
it in just this way, that whenever someone tries to refute it, he’s forced to
say mutually contrary things about it?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean? Say it more clearly.
VISITOR : You shouldn’t expect more clarity from me. I was the one who
made the statement that that which is not should not share either in oneor e
inplurality. But even so I’ve continued after all that to speak of it as one,
since I say that which is not. You understand?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And again a little earlier I said that it isunutterable, unsayable,
and inexpressible in speech. Do you follow?
THEAETETUS : I follow, of course.
VISITOR : So in trying to attach being to it wasn’t I saying things that were 239
the contrary of what I’d said before?
THEAETETUS : Apparently.
VISITOR : And in attaching that which,10wasn’t I speaking of it as one?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
10. Accepting the conjecture to“to,” translated by “that which” on the view that it is
part of the phrase to me¯on, which is generally translated by “that which is not.” In Greek
the form is singular (in contrast with ta, for example, “those which”).260 Sophist
VISITOR : And also in speaking of it as something inexpressible in speech,
unsayable, and unutterable, I was speaking of it as one thing.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But we say that if someone speaks correctly he shouldn’td e ﬁ-
nitely ﬁx it as either one or plural. He shouldn’t even call it itat all, since
even calling it by that label he’d be addressing it by means of the form, one.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : Then what would somebody say about me? He’d ﬁnd that the b
refutation of that which is not has been defeating me for a long time. So,
as I said, let’s not use what I say to help us think of how to speak correctly
about that which is not. Come on, let’s use what you say instead.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
VISITOR : Come on, pull yourself together for us as well as you can and
try it —since you’re young. Try to say something correct about that which
is not, without attaching either being, one, or numerical plurality to it.
THEAETETUS :I’d have to have a strangely large amount of enthusiasm c
for the project to try it myself after seeing what you’ve gone through.
VISITOR : Well, let’s give up on both you and me, if you prefer. But until
we meet someone who can do it let’s say that the sophist has stopped at
nothing. He’s escaped down into inaccessible confusion.
THEAETETUS : He certainly seems to have.
VISITOR : So if we say he has some expertise in appearance-making, it
will be easy for him to grab hold of our use of words in return and twist d
our words in the contrary direction. Whenever we call him a copy-maker
he’ll ask us what in the world we mean by a “copy.” We need to think,
Theaetetus, about how to answer the young man’s question.
THEAETETUS : Obviously we’ll say we mean copies in water and mirrors,
and also copies that are drawn and stamped and everything else like
that.
VISITOR : Evidently, Theaetetus, you haven’t seen a sophist. e
THEAETETUS : Why do you say that?
VISITOR :H e’ll seem to you to have his eyes shut, or else not to have any
eyes at all.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR :H e ’ll laugh at what you say when you answer him that way,
with talk about things in mirrors or sculptures, and when you speak
to him as if he could see. He’ll pretend he doesn’t know about mirrors 240
or water or even sight, and he’ll put his question to you only in terms
of words.
THEAETETUS : What sort of question?
VISITOR :H e ’ll ask about what runs through all those things which you
call many, but which you thought you should call by the one name, copy,
to cover them all, as if they were all one thing. Say something, then, and
defend yourself, and don’t give any ground to him.Sophist 261
THEAETETUS : What in the world would we say a copy is, sir, except
something that’s made similar to a true thing and is another thing that’s b
like it?
VISITOR : You’re saying it’s another true thing like it? Or what do you
mean by like it?
THEAETETUS : Not that it’s true at all, but that it resembles the true thing.
VISITOR : Meaning by true, really being?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And meaning by not true, contrary of true?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : So you’re saying that that which is like is not really that which
is, if you speak of it as not true.
THEAETETUS : But it is, in a way.
VISITOR : But not truly, you say.
THEAETETUS : No, except that it really is a likeness.
VISITOR :S oi t ’s not really what is, but it really is what we call a likeness?
THEAETETUS : Maybe that which is not is woven together with that which c
isin some way like that —it’s quite bizarre.
VISITOR : Of course it’s strange. Anyway, you can see that the many-
headed sophist is still using this interweaving to force us to agree unwill-
ingly that that which is not in a way is.
THEAETETUS :Id e ﬁnitely do see it.
VISITOR : Well then, how can we deﬁne his ﬁeld of expertise, so as to
be consistent?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean? What kind of problem are you afraid of?
VISITOR : When we say that he deceives us about appearances and that d
he’s an expert at deception, are we saying so because his expertise makes
our souls believe what is false? Or what shall we say?
THEAETETUS : Just that. What else would we say?
VISITOR : Again, a false belief will be a matter of believing things that are
contrary to those which are? Or what?
THEAETETUS : Yes, contrary.
VISITOR : So you’re saying that a false belief is believing those which
are not.
THEAETETUS : Necessarily.
VISITOR : Believing that those which are not are not, or that those which e
in no way are in a way are?
THEAETETUS : That those which are not are in a way, it has to be, if anyone
is ever going to be even a little bit wrong.
VISITOR : Well, doesn’t a false belief also believe that those which com-
pletely are in no way are?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And this is false too?
THEAETETUS : Yes.262 Sophist
VISITOR : And I think we’ll also regard false speaking the same way, as 241
saying that those which are are not, and that those which are not are.
THEAETETUS : How else would it be false?
VISITOR : I don’t suppose there’s any other way. The sophist, though, is
going to deny that this way is possible. And how could any sensible person
accept it, now that what we agreed to earlier has been reinforced.11Do we
understand what he’s saying, Theaetetus?
THEAETETUS : How could we not understand that when we dare to say
that falsity is in beliefs and words contain falsity, we’re saying what is
contrary to what we said just before. We’re forced to attach that which is b
to that which is not, even though we agreed just now that that’s com-
pletely impossible.
VISITOR : Your memory’s correct. But think about what we need to do
about the sophist. You see how many and easily available his supply of
objections and confusions is if we assume, as we search for him, that he’s
an expert at cheating and falsehood-making.
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.
VISITOR :H e ’s got a practically inﬁnite supply of them, and we’ve gone c
through only a small fraction.
THEAETETUS : If so, then it seems it would be impossible to catch him.
VISITOR : What, then? Are we going to go soft and give up?
THEAETETUS : I say we shouldn’t, if there’s even the smallest chance that
we can catch him.
VISITOR : So you’ll be forgiving and, as you said, happy if we can somehow
extricate ourselves even slightly from such a powerful argument?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Then I’ve got something even more urgent to request. d
THEAETETUS : What?
VISITOR : Not to think that I’m turning into some kind of patricide.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
VISITOR : In order to defend ourselves we’re going to have to subject
father Parmenides’ saying to further examination, and insist by brute force
both that that which is not somehow is, and then again that that which is
somehow is not.
THEAETETUS : It does seem that in what we’re going to say, we’ll to have
toﬁght through that issue.
VISITOR : That’s obvious even to a blind man, as they say. We’ll never be e
able to avoid having to make ourselves ridiculous by saying conﬂicting
things whenever we talk about false statements and beliefs, either as copies
or likenesses or imitations or appearances, or about whatever sorts of
expertise there are concerning those things —unless, that is, we either refute
Parmenides’ claims or else agree to accept them.
11. I.e., 237a –238c, reinforced by 238d –239c.Sophist 263
THEAETETUS : That’s true.
VISITOR : So that’s why we have to be bold enough to attack what our 242
father says. Or, if fear keeps us from doing that, then we’ll have to leave
it alone completely.
THEAETETUS : Fear, anyway, isn’t going to stop us.
VISITOR : Well then, I’ve got a third thing to ask you, something small.
THEAETETUS : Just tell me what it is.
VISITOR : When I was talking a minute ago I said that I’ve always given
up whenever I’ve tried to refute what Parmenides said, just the way I did
this time.
THEAETETUS : Yes, you did say that.
VISITOR :I’m afraid I’ll seem insane to you if I’m always shifting my
position back and forth, given what I’ve said. It’s for your sake that we’ll b
be trying to refute what Parmenides said —ifwe can do it.
THEAETETUS : Go ahead, then. Don’t worry about that. I won’t think you’re
behaving inappropriately in any way if you go right ahead with your
refutation and demonstration.
VISITOR : Well then, how shall I begin this dangerous discussion? The
path we absolutely have to turn onto, my boy, is this.
THEAETETUS : Namely, ...?
VISITOR : We have to reconsider whether we may not be somehow con-
fused about things that now seem to be clear, and whether over-hasty c
judgment may make us agree too easily.
THEAETETUS : Say what you mean more clearly.
VISITOR : Parmenides’ way of talking to us has been rather easygoing, it
seems to me. So does the way of talking that everyone uses who has ever
urged us to specify just how many beings there are and what they’re like.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : They each appear to me to tell us a myth, as if we were children.
One tells us that there are three beings, and that sometimes they’re some-
how at war with each other, while at other times they become friendly, d
marry, give birth, and bring up their offspring. Another one says that there
are two beings, wet and dry or hot and cold. He marries them off and
makes them set up house together. And our Eleatic tribe, starting from
Xenophanes and even people before him, tells us their myth on the assump-
tion that what they call “all things” are just one.12Later on, some Ionian
and Sicilian muses both had the idea that it was safer to weave the two e
views together. They say that that which is is both many and one, and is
bound by both hatred and friendship. According to the terser of these
muses, in being taken apart they’re brought together.13The more relaxed
12. This group includes Parmenides of Elea (the Visitor, of course, comes from there).
13. The reference here is to Heraclitus, who was Ionian. See frg. 51 (cf. Plato, Symp. 187a).muses, though, allow things to be free from that condition sometimes.  
They say that all that there is alternates, and that sometimes it’s one and 
friendly under Aphrodite’s influence, but at other times it’s many and at  
war with itself because of some kind of strife.14 It’s hard to say whether 
any one of these thinkers has told us the truth or not, and it wouldn’t be  
appropriate for us to be critical of such renowned and venerable men. But 
it wouldn’t be offensive to note the following thing, either.
THEAETETUS : What?
VISITOR: That they’ve overlooked the many of us and belittled us. 
They’ve simply been talking their way through their explanations, without  
paying any attention to whether we were following them or were left  
behind.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
VISITOR: For heaven’s sake, Theaetetus, do you understand anything of 
what they mean each time one of them says that many or one or two  
things are or have become  or are becoming , or when another one speaks of  
hot mixed with cold and supposes that there are separations and combina -
tions?15 Earlier in my life I used to think I understood exactly what someone  
meant when he said just what we’re confused about now, namely, this is 
not. You do see what confusion we’re in about it?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I do.
VISITOR: But just perhaps the very same thing has happened to us equally 
about is. We say we’re in the clear about it, and that we understand when  
someone says it, but that we don’t understand is not. But maybe we’re in 
the same state about both.
THEAETETUS : Maybe.
VISITOR: And let’s suppose the same thing may be true of the other  
expressions we’ve just used.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR: We can look into most of them later, if that seems to be the  
best thing to do. Now we’ll think about the most fundamental and most  
important expression.
THEAETETUS : Which one? Oh, obviously you’re saying that being is the 
one we have to explore first—that we have to ask what people who say  
it think they’re indicating by it.
VISITOR: You understand exactly, Theaetetus. I’m saying we have to  
follow the track this way. Let’s ask—as if they were here—“Listen, you  
people who say that all things are just some two things, hot and cold or  
some such pair. What are you saying about them both when you say that  
they both are  and each one is? What shall we take this being to be? Is it a

third thing alongside those two beings, so that according to you everything
is no longer two but three? Surely in calling one or the other of the two
of them being, you aren’t saying that they both are, since then in either
case they’d be one and not two.”
THEAETETUS : That’s true.
VISITOR :“But you do want to call both of them being?”
THEAETETUS : Probably.
VISITOR :“But,” we’ll say, “if you did that, friends, you’d also be saying 244
very clearly that the two are one.”
THEAETETUS : That’s absolutely right.
VISITOR :“Then clarify this for us, since we’re confused about it. What
do you want to signify when you say being? Obviously you’ve known for
a long time. We thought we did, but now we’re confused about it. So ﬁrst
teach it to us, so we won’t think we understand what you’re saying when
just the contrary is the case.” Would it be the least bit inappropriate for b
us to ask them this, and anyone else who says that everything is more
than one?
THEAETETUS : Not at all.
VISITOR : Well, then, shouldn’t we do our best to ﬁnd out from the
people who say that everything is one what they mean by being?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Then they should answer this question: “Do you say that only
one thing is?”“ We do,” they’ll say, won’t they?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR :“Well then, you call something being?”
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR :“Is that just what you call one, so that you use two names for c
the same thing? Or what?”
THEAETETUS : How will they answer that question?
VISITOR : Obviously it’s not the easiest thing in the world to answer that
question —or any other question, either —for someone who makes the
supposition that they do.
THEAETETUS : Why not?
VISITOR : Surely it’s absurd for someone to agree that there are two names
when he maintains that there’s only one thing.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And it’s completely absurd, and unacceptable, for someone to
say that there’s a name if there’s no account of it. d
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
VISITOR : If he supposes that a thing is different from its name, then surely
he’s mentioning two things.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And moreover if he supposes that the name is the same as the
thing, he’ll either be forced to say that the name is the name of nothing,266 Sophist
or else, if he says that it’s the name of something, then it’s the name of
nothing other than itself and so will turn out to be only the name of a
name and nothing else.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And also the one, being the name of the one, will also be the one
of the name.16
THEAETETUS : It will have to be.
VISITOR : Well then, will they say that the whole is different from the one
being, or the same as it?
THEAETETUS : Of course they’ll say it’s the same, and they do. e
VISITOR : But suppose a whole is, as even Parmenides says,
All around like the bulk of a well-formed sphere,
Equal-balanced all ways from the middle, since neither anything
more
Must it be, this way or that way, nor anything less.
If it’s like that, then that which is will have a middle and extremities. And
if it has those then it absolutely has to have parts, doesn’t it?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : But if a thing has parts then nothing keeps it from having the 245
characteristic of being one in all its parts, and in that way it’s all being
and it’s also one whole.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But something with that characteristic can’t be just the one itself,
can it?
THEAETETUS : Why not?
VISITOR : Surely a thing that’s truly one, properly speaking, has to be
completely without parts.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : But a thing like what we’ve described, which consists of many b
parts, won’t ﬁt that account.
THEAETETUS : I understand.
VISITOR : Now if that which is has the characteristic of the one in this
way, will it be one and a whole? Or shall we simply deny it’s a whole at all?
THEAETETUS : That’s a hard choice.
VISITOR : You’re right. If it has the characteristic of somehow being one,
it won’t appear to be the same as the one. Moreover, everything will then
be more than one.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
16. Plato is relying on the thought that if the terms “one” and “name” designate one
thing (in the sense that he assumes is relevant), then they are interchangeable, even to
the point of generating the strange phrase “the one of the name.”Sophist 267
VISITOR : Further if that which is is not a whole by possessing that as a c
characteristic, but rather just is the whole itself, that which is will turn out
to be less than itself.
THEAETETUS : Certainly.
VISITOR : And because it’s deprived of itself, that which is will be not being,
according to that account.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And everything will be more than one, since that which is and
the whole will each have its own separate nature.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : But if the whole is not at all, then the very same things are true
ofthat which is, and in addition to not being, it would not even become d
a being.
THEAETETUS : Why not?
VISITOR : Invariably whatever becomes has at some point become as a
whole. So we can’t label either being orbecoming as being without taking
the whole to be among the beings too.
THEAETETUS : That seems entirely right.
VISITOR : And moreover something that isn’t a whole can’tb eo fa n y
quantity at all, since something that’s of a certain quantity has to be a
whole of that quantity, whatever it may be.
THEAETETUS : Exactly.
VISITOR : And millions of other issues will also arise, each generating
indeﬁnitely many confusions, if you say that being is only two or one. e
THEAETETUS : The ones that just turned up show that. One problem led
to another, and at each step there was more and more difﬁculty and
uncertainty about what we’d just said at the previous stage.
VISITOR : We haven’t gone through all the detailed accounts that people
give of that which is and that which is not, but this is enough. Now we have
to look at the people who discuss the issue in another way. Our aim is to
have them all in view and that way to see that saying what that which is 246
is isn’t a bit easier than saying what that which is not is.
THEAETETUS : So we need to go on to these people too.
VISITOR : It seems that there’s something like a battle of gods and giants
among them, because of their dispute with each other over being.17
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : One group drags everything down to earth from the heavenly
region of the invisible, actually clutching rocks and trees with their hands.
When they take hold of all these things they insist that only what offers
tangible contact is, since they deﬁne being as the same as body. And if b
any of the others say that something without a body is, they absolutely
despise him and won’t listen to him any more.
17. See Theogony, esp. 675 –715.268 Sophist
THEAETETUS : These are frightening men you’re talking about. I’ve met
quite a lot of them already.
VISITOR : Therefore the people on the other side of the debate defend
their position very cautiously, from somewhere up out of sight. They insist
violently that true being is certain nonbodily forms that can be thought
about. They take the bodies of the other group, and also what they call
the truth, and they break them up verbally into little bits and call them a c
process of coming-to-be instead of being. There’s a never-ending battle
going on constantly between them about this issue.
THEAETETUS : That’s true.
VISITOR : Let’s talk with each of these groups about the being that they
posit.
THEAETETUS : How shall we do it?
VISITOR :I t’s easier to talk with the ones who put being in the forms.
They’re gentler people. It’s harder —and perhaps just about impossible —
with the ones who drag everything down to body by force. It seems to d
me that we have to deal with them this way.
THEAETETUS : Namely ...?
VISITOR : Mainly by making them actually better than they are —if we
somehow could. But if we can’t do that in fact, then let’s do it in words,
by supposing that they’re willing to answer less wildly than they actually
do. Something that better people agree to is worth more than what worse
ones agree to. Anyway we’re not concerned with the people; we’re looking
for what’s true.
THEAETETUS : That’s absolutely right. e
VISITOR : Then tell the better people to answer you and interpret what
they say.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : Then let them tell us this: do they say that anything is a mor-
tal animal?
THEAETETUS : Of course they do.
VISITOR : And they agree that a mortal animal is an ensouled body?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And so they’re placing soul among the beings? 247
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : What then? Do they say that this soul is just and that soul is
unjust, and that this one’s intelligent and that one isn’t?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But isn’t a soul just by the possession and presence of justice,
and isn’t another soul contrary to it by the possession and presence of
the contrary?
THEAETETUS : Yes, they agree with that.
VISITOR : But they’ll say further that at any rate what can be present to
a thing or absent from it is something.THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR: So since there is justice and intelligence and the rest of virtue,  
and also their contraries, and moreover since there is a soul in which those  
things come to be present, do they say that any of these are visible or  
touchable, or that they all are invisible?
THEAETETUS : They can hardly say any of them is visible.
VISITOR: And what about these invisible things? Do they say that they 
have bodies?
THEAETETUS : They don’t give one single answer to that question. They 
do say that the soul seems to them to have a kind of body. But as far as 
intelligence and the other things you’ve asked about are concerned, they’re  
ashamed and don’t dare either to agree that they are not beings or to insist  
that they are all bodies.
VISITOR: Obviously this breed of men has improved, Theaetetus. The  
native earthborn giants would never have been ashamed to hold the line  
for their position, that anything they can’t squeeze in their hands is abso -
lutely nothing.
THEAETETUS : That pretty much describes their thinking.
VISITOR: Then let’s go back to questioning them. It’s enough if they admit 
that even a small part of that which is doesn’t have body. They need to  
say something about what’s common to both it and the things that do 
have body, which they focus on when they say that they both are. Maybe 
that will raise some confusion for them. If it does, then think about whether 
they’d be willing to accept our suggestion that that which is  is something  
like the following.
THEAETETUS : Like what? Tell me and maybe we’ll know.
VISITOR: I’m saying that a thing really is if it has any capacity at all,  
either by nature to do something to something else or to have even the  
smallest thing done to it by even the most trivial thing, even if it only  
happens once. I’ll take it as a definition that those which are amount to  
nothing other than capacity .
THEAETETUS : They accept that, since they don’t have anything better to  
say right now.
VISITOR: Fine. Maybe something else will occur to them later, and to us  
too. For now let’s agree with them on this much. 
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR: Let’s turn to the other people, the friends of the forms. You 
serve as their interpreter for us.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR: You people distinguish coming-to-be and being and say that
they are separate? Is that right?
THEAETETUS : “Yes.”
VISITOR: And you say that by our bodies and through perception we  
have dealings with coming-to-be, but we deal with real being by our souls  Sophist  269
b
c
d
e
248270 Sophist
and through reasoning. You say that being always stays the same and in
the same state, but coming-to-be varies from one time to another.
THEAETETUS :“We do say that.” b
VISITOR : And what shall we say this dealing with is that you apply in the
two cases? Doesn’t it mean what we said just now?
THEAETETUS :“What?”
VISITOR : What happens when two things come together, and by some
capacity one does something to the other or has something done to it. Or
maybe you don’t hear their answer clearly, Theaetetus. But I do, probably
because I’m used to them.
THEAETETUS : Then what account do they give?
VISITOR : They don’t agree with what we just said to the earth people c
about being.
THEAETETUS : What’s that?
VISITOR : We took it as a sufﬁcient deﬁnition of beings that the capacity
be present in a thing to do something or have something done to it, to or
by even the smallest thing or degree.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : In reply they say that coming-to-be has the capacity to do some-
thing or have something done to it, but that this capacity doesn’t ﬁt
with being.
THEAETETUS : Is there anything to that?
VISITOR : We have to reply that we need them to tell us more clearly d
whether they agree that the soul knows and also that being is known.
THEAETETUS :“Yes,” they say.
VISITOR : Well then, do you say that knowing and being known are cases
of doing, or having something done, or both? Is one of them doing and
the other having something done? Or is neither a case of either?
THEAETETUS : Obviously that neither is a case of either, since otherwise
they’d be saying something contrary to what they said before.
VISITOR : Oh, I see. You mean that if knowing is doing something, then e
necessarily what is known has something done to it. When being is known
by knowledge, according to this account, then insofar as it’s known it’s
changed by having something done to it —which we say wouldn’t happen
to something that’s at rest.
THEAETETUS : That’s correct.
VISITOR : But for heaven’s sake, are we going to be convinced that it’s
true that change, life, soul, and intelligence are not present in that which
wholly is, and that it neither lives nor thinks, but stays changeless, solemn, 249
and holy, without any understanding?
THEAETETUS : If we did, sir, we’d be admitting something frightening.
VISITOR : But are we going to say that it has understanding but doesn ’t
have life?
THEAETETUS : Of course not.VISITOR: But are we saying that it has both those things in it while denying  
that it has them in a soul?
THEAETETUS : How else would it have them?
VISITOR: And are we saying that it has intelligence, life, and soul, but 
that it’s at rest and completely changeless even though it’s alive?
THEAETETUS : All that seems completely unreasonable.
VISITOR: Then both that which changes and also change have to be admitted  
as being.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR: And so, Theaetetus, it turns out that if no beings change then  
nothing anywhere possesses any intelligence about anything.18
THEAETETUS : Absolutely not.
VISITOR: But furthermore if we admit that everything is moving and  
changing, then on that account we take the very same thing away from  
those which are.
THEAETETUS : Why?
VISITOR: Do you think that without rest anything would be the same, in 
the same state in the same respects?
THEAETETUS : Not at all.
VISITOR: Well then, do you see any case in which intelligence is or comes-
to-be anywhere without these things?
THEAETETUS : Not in the least.
VISITOR: And we need to use every argument we can to fight against 
anyone who does away with knowledge, understanding, and intelligence  
but at the same time asserts anything at all about anything.
THEAETETUS : Definitely.
VISITOR: The philosopher—the person who values these things the  
most—absolutely has to refuse to accept the claim that everything is at  
rest, either from defenders of the one or from friends of the many forms.  
In addition he has to refuse to listen to people who make that which is 
change in every way. He has to be like a child begging for “both,” and  
say that that which is—everything—is both the unchanging and that 
which changes.
THEAETETUS : True.
VISITOR: Well now, apparently we’ve done a fine job of making our  
account pull together that which is, haven’t we?
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR: But for heaven’s sake, Theaetetus, . . . NowI think we’ll recognize  
how confused our investigation about it is.
THEAETETUS : Why, though? What do you mean?
VISITOR: Don’t you notice, my young friend, that we’re now in extreme  
ignorance about it, though it appears to us that we’re saying something.

e272 Sophist
THEAETETUS : It does to me anyway. But I don’t completely understand
how we got into this situation without noticing.
VISITOR : Then think more clearly about it. Given what we’ve just agreed
to, would it be fair for someone to ask us the same question we earlier 250
asked the people who say that everything is just hotand cold?
THEAETETUS : What was it? Remind me.
VISITOR : Certainly. And I’ll try, at any rate, to do it by asking you in
just the same way as I asked them, so that we can move forward at the
same pace.
THEAETETUS : Good.
VISITOR : Now then, wouldn’t you say that change and rest are completely
contrary to each other?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And you’d say they both equally are, and that each of them
equally is?
THEAETETUS : Yes. b
VISITOR : When you admit that they are, are you saying that both and
each of them change?
THEAETETUS : Not at all.
VISITOR : And are you signifying that they rest when you say that they
both are?
THEAETETUS : Of course not.
VISITOR : So do you conceive that which is as a third thing alongside them
which encompasses rest and change? And when you say that they both
are, are you taking the two of them together and focusing on their associa-
tion with being?
THEAETETUS : It does seem probably true that when we say change and c
rest are, we do have a kind of omen of that which is as a third thing.
VISITOR :S othat which is isn’t both change and rest; it’s something different
from them instead.
THEAETETUS : It seems so.
VISITOR : Therefore by its own nature that which is doesn’t either rest
or change.
THEAETETUS : I suppose it doesn’t.
VISITOR : Which way should someone turn his thoughts if he wants to
establish for himself something clear about it?
THEAETETUS : I don’t know.
VISITOR : I don’t think any line is easy. If something isn’t changing, how
can it not be resting? And how can something not change if it doesn’ti n d
any way rest? But now that which is appears to fall outside both of them.
Is that possible?
THEAETETUS : Absolutely not.
VISITOR : In this connection we ought to remember the following.
THEAETETUS : What?Sophist 273
VISITOR : When we were asked what we should apply the name that which
is not to, we became completely confused. Do you remember?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And now aren’t we in just as much confusion about that e
which is?
THEAETETUS : We seem to be in even more confusion, if that’s possible.
VISITOR : Then we’ve now given a complete statement of our confusion.
But there’s now hope, precisely because both that which is and that which
is not are involved in equal confusion. That is, in so far as one of them is
clariﬁed, either brightly or dimly, the other will be too. And if we can’t 251
see either of them, then anyway we’ll push our account of both of them
forward as well as we can.
THEAETETUS : Fine.
VISITOR : Let’s give an account of how we call the very same thing,
whatever it may be, by several names.
THEAETETUS : What, for instance? Give me an example.
VISITOR : Surely we’re speaking of a man even when we name him several
things, that is, when we apply colors to him and shapes, sizes, defects,
and virtues. In these cases and a million others we say that he’s not only
a man but also is good and indeﬁnitely many different things. And similarly b
on the same account we take a thing to be one, and at the same time we
speak of it as many by using many names for it.
THEAETETUS : That’s true.
VISITOR : Out of all this we’ve prepared a feast for young people and for
old late-learners. They can grab hold of the handy idea that it’s impossible
for that which is many to be one and for that which is one to be many.
They evidently enjoy forbidding us to say that a man is good, and only c
letting us say that that which is good is good, or that the man is a man.
You’ve often met people, I suppose, who are carried away by things like
that. Sometimes they’re elderly people who are amazed at this kind of thing,
because their understanding is so poor and they think they’ve discovered
something prodigiously wise.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Then let’s direct our questions now both to these people and d
also to the others we were talking with before. That way our account will
be addressed to everyone who’s ever said anything at all about being.
THEAETETUS : What questions do you mean?
VISITOR : Shall we refuse to apply being to change or to rest, or anything
to anything else? Shall we take these things to be unblended and incapable
of having a share of each other in the things we say? Or shall we pull
them all together and treat them all as capable of associating with each
other? Or shall we say that some can associate and some can’t? Which of
these options shall we say they’d choose, Theaetetus? e
THEAETETUS : I don’t know how to answer for them.274 Sophist
VISITOR : Why don’t you reply to the options one by one by thinking
about what results from each of them?
THEAETETUS : Fine.
VISITOR : First, if you like, let’s take them to say that nothing has any
capacity at all for association with anything. Then change and rest won’t
have any share in being.
THEAETETUS : No, they won’t. 252
VISITOR : Well then, will either of them be, if they have no association
with being?
THEAETETUS : No.
VISITOR : It seems that agreeing to that destroys everything right away,
both for the people who make everything change, for the ones who make
everything an unchanging unit, and for the ones who say that beings are
forms that always stay the same and in the same state. All of these people
apply being. Some do it when they say that things really are changing, and
others do it when they say that things really are at rest.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : Also there are people who put everything together at one time b
and divide them at another.19Some put them together into one and divide
them into indeﬁnitely many, and others divide them into a ﬁnite number
of elements and put them back together out of them. None of these people,
regardless of whether they take this to happen in stages or continuously,
would be saying anything if there isn’t any blending.
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : But furthermore the most ridiculous account is the one that’s
adopted by the people who won’t allow anything to be called by a name
that it gets by association with something else.
THEAETETUS : Why? c
VISITOR : They’re forced to use being about everything, and also separate,
from others, of itself, and a million other things. They’re powerless to keep
from doing it —that is, from linking them together in their speech. So they
don’t need other people to refute them, but have an enemy within, as
people say, to contradict them, and they go carrying him around talking
in an undertone inside them like the strange ventriloquist Eurycles.20
THEAETETUS : That’s a very accurate comparison. d
VISITOR : Well then, what if we admit that everything has the capacity
to associate with everything else?
THEAETETUS : I can solve that one.
VISITOR : How?
THEAETETUS : Because if change and rest belonged to each other then change
would be completely at rest and conversely rest itself would be changing.
19. These thinkers were introduced at 242c –d, e–243a.
20. See Aristophanes, Wasps, 1017 –20.Sophist 275
VISITOR : But I suppose it’s ruled out by very strict necessity that change
should be at rest and that rest should change.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : So the third option is the only one left.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Certainly one of the following things has to be the case: either e
everything is willing to blend, or nothing is, or some things are and some
are not.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And we found that the ﬁrst two options were impossible.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So everyone who wants to give the right answer will choose
the third.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : Since some will blend and some won’t, they’ll be a good deal 253
like letters of the alphabet. Some of them ﬁt together with each other and
some don’t.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : More than the other letters the vowels run through all of them
like a bond, linking them together, so that without a vowel no one of the
others can ﬁt with another.
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.
VISITOR : So does everyone know which kinds of letters can associate
with which, or does it take an expert?
THEAETETUS : It takes an expert.
VISITOR : What kind?
THEAETETUS : An expert in grammar.
VISITOR : Well then, isn’t it the same with high and low notes? The b
musician is the one with the expertise to know which ones mix and
which ones don’t, and the unmusical person is the one who doesn’t
understand that.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And in other cases of expertise and the lack of it we’ll ﬁnd
something similar.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Well then, we’ve agreed that kinds mix with each other in the
same way. So if someone’s going to show us correctly which kinds harmo-
nize with which and which kinds exclude each other, doesn’t he have to
have some kind of knowledge as he proceeds through the discussion? And c
in addition doesn’t he have to know whether there are any kinds that run
through all of them and link them together to make them capable of
blending, and also, when there are divisions, whether certain kinds running
through wholes are always the cause of the division?
THEAETETUS : Of course that requires knowledge —probably just about
the most important kind.276 Sophist
VISITOR : So, Theaetetus, what shall we label this knowledge? Or for
heaven’s sake, without noticing have we stumbled on the knowledge that
free people have? Maybe we’ve found the philosopher even though we
were looking for the sophist?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
VISITOR : Aren’t we going to say that it takes expertise in dialectic to d
divide things by kinds and not to think that the same form is a different
one or that a different form is the same?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So if a person can do that, he’ll be capable of adequately discrimi-
nating a single form spread out all through a lot of other things, each of
which stands separate from the others. In addition he can discriminate
forms that are different from each other but are included within a single
form that’s outside them, or a single form that’s connected as a unit
throughout many wholes, or many forms that are completely separate
from others.21That’s what it is to know how to discriminate by kinds how e
things can associate and how they can’t.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : And you’ll assign this dialectical activity only to someone who
has a pure and just love of wisdom.
THEAETETUS : You certainly couldn’t assign it to anyone else.
VISITOR :W e ’llﬁnd that the philosopher will always be in a location like
this if we look for him. He’s hard to see clearly too, but not in the same 254
way as the sophist.
THEAETETUS : Why not?
VISITOR : The sophist runs off into the darkness of that which is not, which
he’s had practice dealing with, and he’s hard to see because the place is
so dark. Isn’t that right?
THEAETETUS : It seems to be.
VISITOR : But the philosopher always uses reasoning to stay near the form,
being.H ei s n ’t at all easy to see because that area is so bright and the eyes
of most people’s souls can’t bear to look at what’s divine. b
THEAETETUS : That seems just as right as what you just said before.
VISITOR :W e ’ll think about the philosopher more clearly soon if we want
to. But as far as the sophist is concerned we obviously shouldn’t give up
until we’ve gotten a good enough look at him.
THEAETETUS : Fine.
21. Alternatively, the two previous sentences can be translated: “So if a person can do
that, he’ll adequately discriminate a single form spread out all through many, each of
which stands separate from the others, and many forms that are different from each
other but are included within a single form that’s outside them; and another single form
connected as a unit through many wholes, and many forms that are all marked off
in separation.”Sophist 277
VISITOR :W e ’ve agreed on this: some kinds will associate with each other
and some won’t, some will to a small extent and others will associate a
great deal, nothing prevents still others from being all-pervading —from c
being associated with every one of them. So next let’s pursue our account
together this way. Let’s not talk about every form. That way we won’tb e
thrown off by dealing with too many of them. Instead let’s choose some
of the most important ones. First we’ll ask what they’re like, and next
we’ll ask about their ability to associate with each other. Even if our grasp
ofthat which is and that which is not isn’t completely clear, our aim will be
to avoid being totally without an account of them —so far as that’s allowed
by our present line of inquiry —and see whether we can get away with d
saying that that which is not really is that which is not.
THEAETETUS : That’s what we have to do.
VISITOR : The most important kinds we’ve just been discussing are that
which is, rest, and change.
THEAETETUS : Yes, by far.
VISITOR : And we say that two of them don’t blend with each other.
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely not.
VISITOR : But that which is blends with both of them, since presumably
both of them are.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : We do have three of them.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So each of them is different from two of them, but is the same
as itself.
THEAETETUS : Yes. e
VISITOR : But what in the world are the same and the different that we’ve
been speaking of? Are they two kinds other than those three but necessarily
always blending with them? And do we have to think of them all as being
ﬁve and not three? Or have what we’ve been calling the same and the 255
different turned out, without our realizing it, to be among those three?
THEAETETUS : Maybe.
VISITOR : But change and rest are certainly not different orthe same.
THEAETETUS : Why not?
VISITOR : Whatever we call change and rest in common can’t be either
one of them.
THEAETETUS : Why not?
VISITOR : Then change would rest and rest would change. In both cases,
if either change or rest comes to be either same or different, then it will
force the other to change to the contrary of its own nature, since it will b
share in its contrary.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : And both do share in the same and in the different.
THEAETETUS : Yes.278 Sophist
VISITOR : Then anyway let’s not say that change is the same or the different,
nor that rest is.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : But do we have to think of that which is and the same as one thing?
THEAETETUS : Maybe.
VISITOR : But if that which is and the same don’t signify distinct things,
then when we say that change and rest both are, we’ll be labeling both of c
them as being the same.
THEAETETUS : But certainly that’s impossible.
VISITOR :S oi t ’s impossible for the same and that which is to be one.
THEAETETUS : I suppose so.
VISITOR : Shall we take the same as a fourth in addition to the other
three forms?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Well then, do we have to call the different aﬁfth? Or should we
think of it and that which is as two names for one kind?
THEAETETUS : Maybe.
VISITOR : But I think you’ll admit that some of those which are are said
by themselves, but some are always said in relation to other things.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But the different is always said in relation to another, isn’t it? d
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : But it wouldn’tb ei f that which is and the different weren’t
completely distinct. If the different shared in both kinds the way that which
isdoes, then some of the things that are different would be different
without being different in relation to anything different. In fact, though,
it turns out that whatever is different deﬁnitely has to be what it is from
something that’s different.
THEAETETUS : That’s exactly the way it is.
VISITOR : And we do have to call the nature of the different a ﬁfth among e
the forms we’re choosing.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And we’re going to say that it pervades all of them, since each
of them is different from the others, not because of its own nature but
because of sharing in the type of the different.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : Let’s take up each of the ﬁve one by one and say this.
THEAETETUS : What?
VISITOR : First let’s say that change is completely different from rest. Shall
we say that?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So it is not rest.
THEAETETUS : Not at all.
VISITOR : But it is, because it shares in that which is. 256Sophist 279
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Then again change is different from the same.
THEAETETUS : Pretty much.
VISITOR : So it is not the same.
THEAETETUS : No.
VISITOR : But still it was the same, we said,22because everything has a
share of that.
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.
VISITOR : We have to agree without any qualms that change is the same
and not the same. When we say that it’s the same and not the same, we
aren’t speaking the same way. When we say it’s the same, that’s because b
it shares in the same in relation to itself. But when we say it’s not the
same, that’s because of its association with the different. Because of its
association with the different, change is separated from the same, and so
becomes not it but different. So that it’s right to say that it’s not the same.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : So if change itself ever somehow had a share in rest, there would
be nothing strange about labeling it resting?
THEAETETUS : That’s absolutely right, as long as we admit that some kinds
will blend with each other and some won’t.
VISITOR : That, though, we demonstrated earlier, before we came to this c
point, and we showed that by nature it has to be so.23
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : To repeat,24change is different from different, just as it’s other
than both the same and rest.
THEAETETUS : It has to be.
VISITOR : So in a way it is different and not different, according to what
we’ve said.
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : So what next? Are we going to say that change is different from
theﬁrst three but not from the fourth, in spite of the fact that we’ve agreed
that there were ﬁve things we were going to investigate? d
THEAETETUS : How could we do that? We can’t admit that there are fewer
of them than there appeared to be just now.
VISITOR : So shall we go on fearlessly contending that change is different
from that which is?
22. Cf. 255a.
23. At 251a –252c.
24. Alternatively: “Let’s continue, then:” (On this translation, the Visitor is here taking
the next step in his plan announced at 255e8; he has said how change relates to rest and
to the same, and now proceeds to say how it relates to the different —after which, c11
ff., he completes the plan by saying how it relates to being. Thus he is not repeating
anything already said previously.)280 Sophist
THEAETETUS : Yes, we should be absolutely fearless.
VISITOR :S oi t ’s clear that change really is both something that is not, but
also a thing that is since it partakes in that which is?
THEAETETUS : That’s absolutely clear.
VISITOR : So it has to be possible for that which is not to be, in the case of
change and also as applied to all the kinds. That’s because as applied to
all of them the nature of the different makes each of them not be, by making e
it different from that which is. And we’re going to be right if we say that
all of them are not in this same way. And on the other hand we’re also
going to be right if we call them beings, because they have a share in that
which is.
THEAETETUS : It seems that way.
VISITOR : So as concerning each of the forms that which is is extensive,
and that which is not is indeﬁnite in quantity.
THEAETETUS : That seems right.
VISITOR : So we have to say that that which is itself is different from 257
the others.
THEAETETUS : Necessarily.
VISITOR : So even that which is is not, in as many applications as there are
of the others, since, not being them, it is one thing, namely itself, and on
the other hand it is not those others, which are an indeﬁnite number.
THEAETETUS : I suppose so.
VISITOR : So then we shouldn’t even be annoyed about this conclusion,
precisely because it’s the nature of kinds to allow association with each
other. And if somebody doesn’t admit that, then he needs to win us over
from our earlier line of argument for it, in order to win us over from
its consequences.
THEAETETUS : That’s entirely fair.
VISITOR : Now let’s look at this. b
THEAETETUS : What?
VISITOR : It seems that when we say that which is not,w ed o n ’t say some-
thing contrary to that which is, but only something different from it.
THEAETETUS : Why?
VISITOR :I t’s like this. When we speak of something as not large, does it
seem to you that we indicate the small rather than the equal?
THEAETETUS : Of course not.
VISITOR :S ow ew o n ’t agree with somebody who says that negation
signiﬁes a contrary. We’ll only admit this much: when “not” and “non-” c
are preﬁxed to names that follow them, they indicate something other than
the names, or rather, other than the things to which the names following
the negation are applied.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : If you don’t mind, though, let’s think about this.
THEAETETUS : What?Sophist 281
VISITOR : The nature of the different appears to be chopped up, just
like knowledge.
THEAETETUS : Why?
VISITOR : Knowledge is a single thing, too, I suppose. But each part of it
that has to do with something is marked off and has a name peculiar to
itself. That’s why there are said to be many expertises and many kinds d
of knowledge.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And so the same thing happens to the parts of the nature of
the different, too, even though it’s one thing.
THEAETETUS : Maybe. But shall we say how?
VISITOR : Is there a part of the different that’s placed over against the beau-
tiful?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Shall we say that it’s nameless, or does it have a name?
THEAETETUS : It has a name. What we call not beautiful is the thing that’s
different from nothing other than the nature of the beautiful.
VISITOR : Now go ahead and tell me this.
THEAETETUS : What? e
VISITOR : Isn’t it in the following way that the not beautiful turns out to
be, namely, by being both marked off within one kind of those that are,
and also set over against one of those that are?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Then it seems that the not beautiful is a sort of setting of a being
over against a being.
THEAETETUS : That’s absolutely right.
VISITOR : Well then, according to this account, is the beautiful more a
being than the not beautiful?
THEAETETUS : Not at all.
VISITOR : So we have to say that both the not large and the large 258
equally are.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So we also have to put the not just on a par with the just, in
that neither isany more than the other.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And we’ll speak about the others in the same way too, since
the nature of the different appeared as being one of those that are. And
because it is, we have to posit its parts as no less beings.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : So it seems that the setting against each other of the nature of
a part of the different and the nature of that which is is not any less being — b
if we’re allowed to say such a thing —than that which is itself. And it does
not signify something contrary to that which is but only something different
from it.282 Sophist
THEAETETUS : Clearly.
VISITOR : So what shall we call it?
THEAETETUS : Obviously that which is not —which we were looking for
because of the sophist —is just exactly this.
VISITOR : Then does it have just as much being as any of the others, as
you said it did? Should we work up the courage now to say that that which
is not deﬁnitely is something that has its own nature? Should we say that
just as the large was large, the beautiful was beautiful, the not large was not c
large, and the not beautiful was not beautiful, in the same way that which
is not also was and is not being, and is one form among the many that
are? Do we, Theaetetus, still have any doubts about that?
THEAETETUS : No.
VISITOR : You know, our disbelief in Parmenides has gone even farther
than his prohibition.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR :W e ’ve pushed our investigation ahead and shown him some-
thing even beyond what he prohibited us from even thinking about.
THEAETETUS : In what way?
VISITOR : Because he says, remember, d
Never shall it force itself on us, that that which is not may be;
Keep your thought far away from this path of searching.
THEAETETUS : That’s what he says.
VISITOR : But we’ve not only shown that those which are not are. We’ve
also caused what turns out to be the form of that which is not to appear.
Since we showed that the nature of the different is, chopped up among all e
beings in relation to each other, we dared to say that that which is not really
is just this, namely, each part of the nature of the different that’s set over
against that which is.
THEAETETUS : And what we’ve said seems to me completely and totally
true.
VISITOR : Nobody can say that this that which is not, which we’ve made
to appear and now dare to say is, is the contrary of that which is.W e ’ve
said good-bye long ago to any contrary of that which is, and to whether it 259
is or not, and also to whether or not an account can be given of it. With
regard to that which is not, which we’ve said is, let someone refute us and
persuade us that we’ve made a mistake —or else, so long as he can’td o
that, he should say just what we say. He has to say that the kinds blend
with each other, that that which is and the different pervade all of them and
each other, that the different shares in that which is and so, because of that
sharing, is. But he won’t say that it is that which it shares in, but that it
is different from it, and necessarily, because it isdifferent from that which
is, it clearly can be what is not. On the other hand that which is has a share bSophist 283
inthe different, so, being different from all of the others, it is not each of
them and it is not all of the others except itself. So that which is indisputably
is not millions of things, and all of the others together, and also each of
them, are in many ways and also are not in many ways.
THEAETETUS : True.
VISITOR : And if anyone doesn’t believe these contrarieties, he has to think
about them himself and say something better than what we’ve said. But
if he thinks he’s recognized a problem in it and enjoys dragging the c
argument back and forth, then he’s been carried away by something that’s
not worth much of anyone’s attention —to go by what we’ve just been
saying, anyway. A thing like that isn’t clever or hard to discover, but the
other thing is both difﬁcult and at the same time beautiful.
THEAETETUS : What other thing?
VISITOR : The thing we said earlier. That is, we should leave pointless
things like this alone. Instead we should be able to follow what a person
says and scrutinize it step by step. When he says that what’s different is
the same in a certain way or that what’s the same is different in a certain
way, we should understand just what way he means, and the precise d
respect in which he’s saying that the thing is the same or different. But
when someone makes that which is the same appear different in just any
old way, or vice versa, or when he makes what’s large appear small
or something that’s similar appear dissimilar —well, if someone enjoys
constantly trotting out contraries like that in discussion, that’s not true
refutation. It’s only the obvious new-born brain-child of someone who just
came into contact with those which are.25
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.
VISITOR : In fact, my friend, it’s inept to try to separate everything from
everything else. It’s the sign of a completely unmusical and unphilosophi- e
cal person.
THEAETETUS : Why?
VISITOR : To dissociate each thing from everything else is to destroy totally
everything there is to say. The weaving together of forms is what makes
speech possible for us.
THEAETETUS : That’s true.
VISITOR : Think about what a good moment we picked to ﬁght it out 260
against people like that, and to force them further to let one thing blend
with another.
THEAETETUS : Why a good moment?
VISITOR : For speech’s being one kind among those that are. If we were
deprived of that, we’d be deprived of philosophy —to mention the most
important thing. Besides, now we have to agree about what speech is, but
we’d be able to say nothing if speech were taken away from us and weren’t
25. See 234d –e.284 Sophist
anything at all. And it would be taken away if we admitted that there’s b
no blending of anything with anything else.
THEAETETUS : This last thing is right, anyway. But I don’t understand why
we have to agree about speech.
VISITOR : Well, perhaps you’ll understand if you follow me this way.
THEAETETUS : Where?
VISITOR :That which is not appeared to us to be one kind among others,
but scattered over all those which are.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So next we have to think about whether it blends with belief
and speech.
THEAETETUS : Why?
VISITOR : If it doesn’t blend with them then everything has to be true. c
But if it does then there will be false belief and false speech, since falsity
in thinking and speaking amount to believing and saying those that are not.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And if there’s falsity then there’s deception.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And if there’s deception then necessarily the world will be full
of copies, likenesses, and appearances.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : We said that the sophist had escaped into this region, but that
he denied that there has come to be or is such a thing as falsity. For he d
denied that anyone either thinks or says that which is not, on the ground
that that which is not never in any way has a share in being.
THEAETETUS : That’s what he said.
VISITOR : But now it apparently does share in that which is, so he probably
wouldn’t still put up a ﬁght about that. Perhaps, though, he might say
that some forms share in that which is not and some don’t, and that speech
and belief are ones that don’t. So he might contend again that copy-making
and appearance-making —in which we said he was contained —totally are e
not. His ground would be that belief and speech don’t associate with that
which is not, and that without this association falsity totally is not. That’s
why we have to search around for speech, belief, and appearance, and
ﬁrst discover what they are, so that when they appear we see their associa-
tion with that which is not clearly. Then when we’ve seen that clearly we 261
can show that falsity is, and when we’ve shown that we can tie the sophist
up in it, if we can keep hold of him —or else we’ll let him go and look for
him in another kind.
THEAETETUS : What you said at the start seems absolutely true. The sophist
is a hard kind to hunt down. He seems to have a whole supply of road-
blocks, and whenever he throws one down in our way we have to ﬁght
through it before we can get to him. But now when we’ve barely gotten
through the one about how that which is not is not, he’s thrown another
one down and we have to show that falsity is present in both speech and bSophist 285
belief. And next, it seems, there will be another and another after that. A
limit, it seems, never appears.
VISITOR : Even if you can only make a little progress, Theaetetus, you
should cheer up. If you give up in this situation, what will you do some
other time when you don’t get anywhere or even are pushed back? A
person like that would hardly capture a city, as the saying goes. But since c
we’ve done what you just said, my friend, the largest wall may already
have been captured and the rest of them may be lower and easier.
THEAETETUS : Fine.
VISITOR : Then let’s take up speech and belief, as we said just now. That
way we can calculate whether that which is not comes into contact with
them, or whether they’re both totally true and neither one is ever false.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : Come on, then. Let’s think about names again, the same way d
as we spoke about forms and letters of the alphabet. What we’re looking
for seems to lie in that direction.
THEAETETUS : What kind of question about them do we have to answer?
VISITOR : Whether they all ﬁt with each other, or none of them do, or
some of them will and some of them won’t.
THEAETETUS : Anyway it’s clear that some will and some won’t.
VISITOR : Maybe you mean something like this: names that indicate some-
thing when you say them one after another ﬁt together, and names that e
don’t signify anything when you put them in a row don’t ﬁt.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
VISITOR : The same thing I thought you were assuming when you agreed
with me just now —since there are two ways to use your voice to indicate
something about being.
THEAETETUS : What are they?
VISITOR : One kind is called names, and the other is called verbs. 262
THEAETETUS : Tell me what each of them is.
VISITOR : A verb is the sort of indication that’s applied to an action.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And a name is the kind of spoken sign that’s applied to things
that perform the actions.
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.
VISITOR : So no speech is formed just from names spoken in a row, and
also not from verbs that are spoken without names.
THEAETETUS : I didn’t understand that.
VISITOR : Clearly you were focusing on something else when you agreed b
with me just now. What I meant was simply this: things don’t form speech
if they’re said in a row like this.
THEAETETUS : Like what?
VISITOR : For example, “walks runs sleeps,” and other verbs that signify
actions. Even if somebody said all of them one after another that wouldn’t
be speech.286 Sophist
THEAETETUS : Of course not.
VISITOR : Again, if somebody said “lion stag horse,” and whatever names
there are of things that perform actions, the series wouldn’t make up c
speech. The sounds he uttered in the ﬁrst or second way wouldn’t indicate
either an action or an inaction or the being of something that is or of
something that is not —not until he mixed verbs with nouns. But when he
did that, they’d ﬁt together and speech —the simplest and smallest kind
of speech, I suppose —would arise from that ﬁrst weaving of name and
verb together.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
VISITOR : When someone says “man learns,” would you say that’s the
shortest and simplest kind of speech?
THEAETETUS : Yes. d
VISITOR : Since he gives an indication about what is, or comes to be, or
has come to be, or is going to be. And he doesn’t just name, but accomplishes
something, by weaving verbs with names. That’s why we said he speaks
and doesn’t just name. In fact this weaving is what we use the word
“speech” for.
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : So some things ﬁt together and some don’t. Likewise some vocal
signs don’t ﬁt together, but the ones that do produce speech. e
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : But there’s still this small point.
THEAETETUS : What?
VISITOR : Whenever there’s speech it has to be about something. It’s
impossible for it not to be about something.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And speech also has to have some particular quality.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Now let’s turn our attention to ourselves.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR :I’ll produce some speech by putting a thing together with an
action by means of a name and a verb. You have to tell me what it’s about.
THEAETETUS :I’ll do it as well as I can. 263
VISITOR :“Theaetetus sits.” That’s not a long piece of speech, is it?
THEAETETUS : No, not too long.
VISITOR : Your job is to tell what it’s about, what it’s of.
THEAETETUS : Clearly it’s about me, of me.
VISITOR : Then what about this one?
THEAETETUS : What one?
VISITOR :“Theaetetus (to whom I’m now talking) ﬂies.”
THEAETETUS : No one would ever deny that it’s of me and about me.
VISITOR : We also say that each piece of speech has to have some particu-
lar quality.Sophist 287
THEAETETUS : Yes. b
VISITOR : What quality should we say each one of these has?
THEAETETUS : The second one is false, I suppose, and the other one is true.
VISITOR : And the true one says those that are, as they are, about you.26
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And the false one says things different from those that are.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So it says those that are not, but that they are.
THEAETETUS : I suppose so.
VISITOR : But they’re different things that are from the things that are
about you —since we said that concerning each thing many beings are and
many are not.27
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR :I nt h e ﬁrst place, the second piece of speech I said about you c
must be one of the shortest there is, according to our deﬁnition of speech.
THEAETETUS : We agreed to that just now, anyway.
VISITOR : And we agreed that it’s of something.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And if it is not of you, it isn’t of anything else.
THEAETETUS : Of course not.
VISITOR : And if it were not of anything it would not be speech at all,
since we showed that it was impossible for speech that is, to be speech
that is of nothing.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely right.
VISITOR : But if someone says things about you, but says different things d
as the same or not beings as beings, then it deﬁnitely seems that false
speech really and truly arises from that kind of putting together of verbs
and names.
THEAETETUS : Yes, very true.
VISITOR : Well then, isn’t it clear by now that both true and false thought
and belief and appearance can occur in our souls?
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : The best way for you to know how is for you ﬁrst to grasp
what they are and how they’re different from each other. e
THEAETETUS : Then just tell me.
VISITOR : Aren’t thought and speech the same, except that what we call
thought is speech that occurs without the voice, inside the soul in conversa-
tion with itself?
26. This sentence is ambiguous. First, the Greek here uses an idiom which could mean
either “says those that are, as they are” or“says those that are, that they are” (cf. 263d).
Secondly, the additional explanatory phrase, “about you,” could be taken with “says,”
with “are,” or with both.
27. See 256e5 –6.288 Sophist
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And the stream of sound from the soul that goes through the
mouth is called speech?
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : And then again we know that speech contains . . .
THEAETETUS : What?
VISITOR :A fﬁrmation and denial.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So when afﬁrmation or denial occurs as silent thought inside 264
the soul, wouldn’t you call that belief?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And what if that doesn’t happen on its own but arises for
someone through perception? When that happens, what else could one
call it correctly, besides appearance?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So since there is true and false speech, and of the processes just
mentioned, thinking appeared to be the soul’s conversation with itself,
belief the conclusion of thinking, and what we call appearing the blending b
of perception and belief, it follows that since these are all the same kind
of thing as speech, some of them must sometimes be false.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : So you realize we’ve found false belief and speech sooner than
we expected to just now. Then we were afraid that to look for it would
be to attack a completely hopeless project.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So let’s not be discouraged about what’s still left. Since these
other things have come to light, let’s remember the divisions by types that c
we made earlier.
THEAETETUS : Which ones?
VISITOR : We divided copy-making into two types, likeness-making and
appearance-making.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And we said we were confused about which one to put the
sophist in.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And in our confusion about that we plunged into even greater
bewilderment, when an account emerged that disagreed with everyone,
by denying that there are likenesses or copies or appearances at all, on
the ground that there isn’t ever any falsity in any way anywhere. d
THEAETETUS : That’s right.
VISITOR : But now since false speech and false belief both appear to be,
it’s possible for imitations of those that are to be, and for expertise in
deception to arise from that state of affairs.
THEAETETUS : Yes.Sophist 289
VISITOR : And we agreed before that the sophist does fall under one of
the two types we just mentioned.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Then let’s try again to take the kind we’ve posited and cut it
in two. Let’s go ahead and always follow the righthand part of what we’ve e
cut, and hold onto things that the sophist is associated with until we strip
away everything that he has in common with other things. Then when
we’ve left his own peculiar nature, let’s display it, especially to ourselves
but also to people to whom this sort of procedure is naturally congenial. 265
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : Didn’t we begin by dividing expertise into productive and ac-
quisitive?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And under the acquisitive part the sophist appeared in hunting,
combat, wholesaling, and types of that sort.28
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But now, since he’s included among experts in imitation, ﬁrst
we obviously have to divide productive expertise in two. We say imitation
is a sort of production, but of copies and not of the things themselves. Is b
that right?
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : First of all, production has two parts.
THEAETETUS : What are they?
VISITOR : Divine and human.
THEAETETUS : I don’t understand yet.
VISITOR : If you remember how we started,29we said production was any
capacity that causes things to come to be that previously were not.
THEAETETUS : I remember.
VISITOR : Take animals and everything mortal, including plants and every- c
thing on the earth that grows from seeds and roots, and also all lifeless
bodies made up inside the earth, whether fusible or not. Are we going to
say that anything besides the craftsmanship of a god makes them come
to be after previously not being? Or shall we rely on the saying and the
widespread belief that ...?
THEAETETUS : That what?
VISITOR : Are we going to say that nature produces them by some sponta-
neous cause that generates them without any thought, or by a cause that
works by reason and divine knowledge derived from a god?
THEAETETUS : I often shift back and forth on that from one view to the d
other, maybe because of my age. When I’m focusing on you now, and
28. See 221c –225a.
29. See 219b.290 Sophist
supposing that you think they come to be by the agency of a god, that ’s
what I think too.
VISITOR : Fine, Theaetetus. If we thought you were the kind of person
who might believe something different in the future we’d try to use some
cogent, persuasive argument to make you agree. But since I know what
your nature is and I know, too, that even without arguments from us it e
will tend in the direction that it’s pulled toward now, I’ll let the issue go.
It would take too much time. I’ll assume divine expertise produces the
things that come about by so-called nature, and that human expertise
produces the things that humans compound those things into. According
to this account there are two kinds of production, human and divine.
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : Since there are two of them, cut each of them in two again.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR :I t’sa si fy o u ’d already cut production all the way along its 266
width, and now you’ll cut it along its length.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : That way there are four parts of it all together, two human ones
related to us and two divine ones related to the gods.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Then if we take the division we made the ﬁrst way, one part
of each of those parts is the production of originals. Just about the best
thing to call the two parts that are left might be “copy-making.” That way,
production is divided in two again.
THEAETETUS : Tell me again how each of them is divided. b
VISITOR : We know that we human beings and the other living things,
and also ﬁre, water, and things like that, which natural things come from,
are each generated and produced by a god. Is that right?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And there are copies of each of these things, as opposed to the
things themselves, that also come about by divine workmanship.
THEAETETUS : What kinds of things?
VISITOR : Things in dreams, and appearances that arise by themselves
during the day. They’re shadows when darkness appears in ﬁrelight, and
they’re reﬂections when a thing’s own light and the light of something c
else come together around bright, smooth surfaces and produce an
appearance that looks the reverse of the way the thing looks from
straight ahead.
THEAETETUS : Yes, those are two products of divine production —the
things themselves and the copies corresponding to each one.
VISITOR : And what about human expertise? We say housebuilding makes
a house itself and drawing makes a different one, like a human dream
made for people who are awake.
THEAETETUS : Of course. dSophist 291
VISITOR : And just the same way in other cases, too, there are pairs of
products of human production, that is, the thing itself, we say, and the
copy.
THEAETETUS : Now I understand better and I take it that there are two
kinds of double production, divine and human in each division. One kind
produces things themselves, and the other kind produces things similar
to them.
VISITOR : Let’s recall that one part of copy-making is likeness-making.
The other kind was going to be appearance-making, if falsity appeared to
be truly falsity and by nature one of those that are. e
THEAETETUS : Yes, it was.
VISITOR : But falsity did turn out that way, so are we going to count
likeness-making and appearance-making as indisputably two forms?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Then let’s divide appearance-making in two again. 267
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : Into one sort that’s done with tools and one that uses one’s own
self as the tool of the person making the appearance.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
VISITOR : When somebody uses his own body or voice to make something
similar to your body or voice, I think the best thing to call this part of
appearance-making is “imitating.”
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Let’s set this part off by calling it imitation, and let’s be lazy
and let the other part go. We’ll leave it to someone else to bring it together b
into a unit and give it a suitable name.
THEAETETUS : All right, let’s take the one and let the other go.
VISITOR : But the right thing, Theaetetus, is still to take imitation to have
two parts. Think about why.
THEAETETUS : Tell me.
VISITOR : Some imitators know what they’re imitating and some don’t.
And what division is more important than the one between ignorance
and knowledge?
THEAETETUS : None.
VISITOR : Wasn’t the imitation that we just mentioned the kind that’s
associated with knowledge? Someone who knew you and your character
might imitate you, mightn’t he?
THEAETETUS : Of course. c
VISITOR : What about the character of justice and all of virtue taken to-
gether? Don’t many people who are ignorant of it, but have some beliefs
about it, try hard to cause what they believe it is to appear to be present
in them. And don’t they imitate it in their words and actions as much as
they can?
THEAETETUS : Very many people do that.292 Sophist
VISITOR : And are they all unsuccessful at seeming to be just without
being just at all? Or is the opposite true?
THEAETETUS : Yes, the opposite.
VISITOR : I think we have to say that this person, who doesn’t know, is d
a very different imitator from the previous one, who does.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Where would you get a suitable name for each of them? Isn’t
it obviously hard to, just because the people who came before us were
thoughtless and lazy about dividing kinds into types, and so they never
even tried to divide them. That’s why we necessarily lack a good supply
of names. Still, even though it sounds daring let’s distinguish them by
calling imitation accompanied by belief “belief-mimicry” and imitation e
accompanied by knowledge “informed mimicry.”
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : Then we need to use the former term, since the sophist isn’t
one of the people who know but is one of the people who imitate.
THEAETETUS : He certainly is.
VISITOR : Let’s examine the belief-mimic the way people examine iron,
to see whether it’s sound or has a crack in it.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : Well, it has a big one. One sort of belief-mimic is foolish and 268
thinks he knows the things he only has beliefs about. The other sort has
been around a lot of discussions, and so by temperament he’s suspicious
and fearful that he doesn’t know the things that he pretends in front of
others to know.
THEAETETUS : There deﬁnitely are both types that you’ve mentioned.
VISITOR : Shall we take one of these to be a sort of sincere imitator and
the other to be an insincere one?
THEAETETUS : That seems right.
VISITOR : And are there one or two kinds of insincere ones?
THEAETETUS : You look and see.
VISITOR : I’m looking, and there clearly appear to be two. I see that one b
sort can maintain his insincerity in long speeches to a crowd, and the other
uses short speeches in private conversation to force the person talking
with him to contradict himself.
THEAETETUS : You’re absolutely right.
VISITOR : How shall we show up the long-winded sort, as a statesman
or as a demagogue?
THEAETETUS : A demagogue.
VISITOR : And what shall we call the other one? Wise, or a sophist?
THEAETETUS : We can’t call him wise, since we took him not to know
anything. But since he imitates the wise man he’ll obviously have a name c
derived from the wise man’s name. And now at last I see that we have
to call him the person who is really and truly a sophist.Sophist 293
VISITOR : Shall we weave his name together from start to ﬁnish and tie
it up the way we did before?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Imitation of the contrary-speech-producing, insincere and un-
knowing sort, of the appearance-making kind of copy-making, the word-
juggling part of production that’s marked off as human and not divine. 268d
Anyone who says the sophist is of this “blood and family”30will be saying,
it seems, the complete truth.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.`;
