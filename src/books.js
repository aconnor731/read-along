export const books = `THEAETETUSPlato has much to say in other dialogues about knowledge, but this is his only
sustained inquiry into the question ‘What isknowledge?’ As such, it is the
founding document of what has come to be known as ‘epistemology’, as one of
the branches of philosophy; its inﬂuence on Greek epistemology—in Aristotle
and the Stoics particularly—is strongly marked. Theaetetus was a famous
mathematician, Plato’s associate for many years in the Academy; the dialogue’s
prologue seems to announce the work as published in his memory, shortly after
his early death on military service in 369 B.C.We can therefore date the publica-
tion of Theaetetus fairly precisely, to the few years immediately following
Theaetetus’ death. Plato was then about sixty years of age, and another famous
longtime associate, Aristotle, was just joining the Academy as a student (367).
Though it is not counted as a ‘Socratic’ dialogue—one depicting Socrates in-
quiring into moral questions by examining and refuting the opinions of his fel-
low discussants— Theaetetus depicts a Socrates who makes much of his own
ignorance and his subordinate position as questioner, and the dialogue con-
cludes inconclusively. Socrates now describes his role, however, as he does not
in the ‘Socratic’ dialogues, as that of a ‘midwife’: he brings to expression ideas
of clever young men like Theaetetus, extensively develops their presuppositions
and consequences so as to see clearly what the ideas amount to, and then estab-
lishes them as sound or defective by independent arguments of his own. The
ﬁrst of Theaetetus’ three successive deﬁnitions of knowledge—that knowledge is
‘perception’—is not ﬁnally ‘brought to birth’ until Socrates has linked it to Pro-
tagoras’ famous ‘man is the measure’ doctrine of relativistic truth, and also to
the theory that ‘all is motion and change’ that Socrates ﬁnds most Greek think-
ers of the past had accepted, and until he has ﬁtted it out with an elaborate
and ingenious theory of perception and how it works. He then examines sepa-
rately the truth of these linked doctrines—introduced into the discussion by
him, not Theaetetus—and, in ﬁnally rejecting Theaetetus’ idea as unsound, he
advances his own positive analysis of perception and its role in knowledge.
This emphasis on the systematic exploration of ideas before ﬁnally committing
oneself to them or rejecting them as unsound is found in a different guise in
Parmenides, with its systematic exploration of hypotheses about unity as a
means of working hard toward an acceptable theory of Forms. Socrates estab-
lishes a clear link between the two dialogues when, at 183e, he drags in a refer-
ence back to the conversation reported in Parmenides.
Theaetetus has a unique format among Plato’s dialogues. The prologue
gives a brief conversation between Euclides and Terpsion, Socratics from
157158 Theaetetus
nearby Megara (they are among those present for the discussion on Socrates’
last day in Phaedo). For the remainder, a slave reads out a book composed by
Euclides containing a conversation of Socrates, Theodorus, and Theaetetus that
took place many years previously. Since ancient sources tell us of Socratic dia-
logues actually published by Euclides, it is as if, except for the prologue, Plato
is giving us under his own name one of Euclides’ dialogues! The last line of
the work establishes it as the ﬁrst of a series, with Sophist andStatesman to
follow —as noted above, Parmenides precedes. In Theaetetus Socrates tests
Theaetetus’ mettle with the geometer Theodorus’ aid and in the presence of his
namesake Socrates, another associate of Plato’s in the Academy; in the other
two works, ﬁrst Theaetetus, then young Socrates will be discussion partners
with an unnamed visitor from Elea, in Southern Italy, home to Parmenides
and Zeno —a very different type of partner. Socrates and his midwifery are su-
perseded.
Despite its lively and intellectually playful Socrates, reminiscent of the ‘So-
cratic’ dialogues, Theaetetus is a difﬁcult work of abstract philosophical the-
ory. The American logician and philosopher C. S. Peirce counted it, along with
Parmenides, as Plato’s greatest work, and more recently it has attracted favor-
able attention from such major philosophers as Ludwig Wittgenstein and Gil-
bert Ryle.J.M.C.
EUCLIDES : Are you only just in from the country, Terpsion? Or have you 142
been here some time?
TERPSION : I’ve been here a good while. In fact, I have been looking for
you in the market-place and wondering that I couldn’t ﬁnd you.
EUCLIDES : Well, you couldn’t, because I was not in the city.
TERPSION : Where have you been, then?
EUCLIDES : I went down to the harbor; and as I was going, I met Theaetetus,
being taken to Athens from the camp at Corinth.
TERPSION : Alive or dead?
EUCLIDES : Alive; but that’s about all one could say. Badly wounded for b
one thing; but the real trouble is this sickness that has broken out in
the army.
TERPSION : Dysentery?
EUCLIDES : Yes.
TERPSION : What a man to lose!
EUCLIDES : Yes. A ﬁne man, Terpsion. Only just now I was listening to
some people singing his praises for the way he behaved in the battle.
TERPSION : Well, there’s nothing extraordinary about that. Much more to
be wondered at if he hadn’t distinguished himself. But why didn’t he put c
up here at Megara?
Translated by M. J. Levett, revised by Myles Burnyeat.Theaetetus 159
EUCLIDES : He was in a hurry to get home. I kept asking him myself, and
advising him; but he wouldn’t. So I saw him on his way. And as I was
coming back, I thought of Socrates and what a remarkably good prophet
he was —as usual —about Theaetetus. It was not long before his death, if
I remember rightly, that he came across Theaetetus, who was a boy at the
time. Socrates met him and had a talk with him, and was very much struck
with his natural ability; and when I went to Athens, he repeated to me
the discussion they had had, which was well worth listening to. And he d
said to me then that we should inevitably hear more of Theaetetus, if he
lived to grow up.
TERPSION : Well, he appears to have been right enough. —But what was
this discussion? Could you tell it to me?
EUCLIDES : Good Lord, no. Not from memory, anyway. But I made some 143
notes of it at the time, as soon as I got home; then afterwards I recalled
it at my leisure and wrote it out, and whenever I went to Athens, I used
to ask Socrates about the points I couldn’t remember, and correct my
version when I got home. The result is that I have got pretty well the
whole discussion in writing.
TERPSION : Yes, of course. I have heard you say that before, and I have
always been meaning to ask you to show it to me, though I have been so
long about it. But is there any reason why we shouldn’t go through it
now? I want a rest, in any case, after my journey in from the country.
EUCLIDES : Well, I shouldn’t mind sitting down either. I saw Theaetetus as b
faras Erineum.Comealong. Wewillgetthe slavetoread ittous whilewerest.
TERPSION : Right.
EUCLIDES : This is the book, Terpsion. You see, I have written it out like
this: I have not made Socrates relate the conversation as he related it to
me, but I represent him as speaking directly to the persons with whom
he said he had this conversation. (These were, he told me, Theodorus the
geometer and Theaetetus.) I wanted, in the written version, to avoid the c
bother of having the bits of narrative in between the speeches —I mean,
when Socrates, whenever he mentions his own part in the discussion, says
‘And I maintained’ or‘I said,’ or, of the person answering, ‘He agreed’ or
‘He would not admit this.’ That is why I have made him talk directly to
them and have left out these formulae.
TERPSION : Well, that’s quite in order, Euclides.
EUCLIDES : Now, boy, let us have it.
SOCRATES : If Cyrene were ﬁrst in my affections, Theodorus, I should be d
asking you how things are there, and whether any of your young people
are taking up geometry or any other branch of philosophy. But, as it is, I
love Athens better than Cyrene, and so I’m more anxious to know which
of our young men show signs of turning out well. That, of course, is what
I am always trying to ﬁnd out myself, as best I can; and I keep asking
other people too —anyone round whom I see the young men are inclined
to gather. Now you, of course, are very much sought after, and with good160 Theaetetus
reason; your geometry alone entitles you to it, and that is not your only e
claim. So if you have come across anyone worth mentioning, I should be
glad to hear.
THEODORUS : Well, Socrates, I think you ought to be told, and I think I
ought to tell you, about a remarkable boy I have met here, one of your
fellow countrymen. And if he were beautiful, I should be extremely nervous
of speaking of him with enthusiasm, for fear I might be suspected of being
in love with him. But as a matter of fact —if you’ll excuse my saying such
a thing —he is not beautiful at all, but is rather like you, snub-nosed, with
eyes that stick out; though these features are not quite so pronounced in
him. I speak without any qualms; and I assure you that among all the 144
people I have ever met —and I have got to know a good many in my
time —I have never yet seen anyone so amazingly gifted. Along with a
quickness beyond the capacity of most people, he has an unusually gentle
temper; and, to crown it all, he is as manly a boy as any of his fellows. I
never thought such a combination could exist; I don’t see it arising else-
where. People as acute and keen and retentive as he is are apt to be very
unbalanced. They get swept along with a rush, like ships without ballast; b
what stands for courage in their makeup is a kind of mad excitement;
while, on the other hand, the steadier sort of people are apt to come to
their studies with minds that are sluggish, somehow —freighted with a
bad memory. But this boy approaches his studies in a smooth, sure, effective
way, and with great good temper; it reminds one of the quiet ﬂow of a
stream of oil. The result is that it is astonishing to see how he gets through
his work, at his age.
SOCRATES : That is good news. And he is an Athenian —whose son is he?
THEODORUS : I have heard the name, but I don’t remember it. But he is c
the middle one of this group coming toward us. He and his companions
were greasing themselves outside just now; it looks as if they have ﬁnished
and are coming in here. But look and see if you recognize him.
SOCRATES : Yes, I know him. He’s the son of Euphronius of Sunium —
very much the kind of person, my friend, that you tell me his son is. A
distinguished man in many ways; he left a considerable property too. But
I don’t know the boy’s name.
THEODORUS : His name, Socrates, is Theaetetus. As for the property, that, I d
think, has been made away with by trustees. All the same, he is wonderfully
open-handed about money, Socrates.
SOCRATES : A thoroughbred, evidently. I wish you would ask him to come
and sit with us over here.
THEODORUS : All right. Theaetetus, come here beside Socrates.
SOCRATES : Yes, come along, Theaetetus. I want to see for myself what
sort of a face I have. Theodorus says I am like you. But look. If you and e
I had each had a lyre, and Theodorus had told us that they were both
similarly tuned, should we have taken his word for it straightaway? Or
should we have tried to ﬁnd out if he was speaking with any expert
knowledge of music?Theaetetus 161
THEAETETUS : Oh, we should have inquired into that.
SOCRATES : And if we had found that he was a musician, we should have
believed what he said; but if we found he had no such qualiﬁcation, we
should have put no faith in him.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s true.
SOCRATES : And now, I suppose, if we are interested in this question of
our faces being alike, we ought to consider whether he is speaking with 145
any knowledge of drawing or not?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I should think so.
SOCRATES : Then is Theodorus an artist?
THEAETETUS : No, not so far as I know.
SOCRATES : Nor a geometer, either?
THEAETETUS : Oh, there’s no doubt about his being that, Socrates.
SOCRATES : And isn’t he also a master of astronomy and arithmetic and
music —of all that an educated man should know?
THEAETETUS : Well, he seems to me to be.
SOCRATES : Then if he asserts that there is some physical resemblance
between us —whether complimenting us or the reverse —one ought not to
pay much attention to him?
THEAETETUS : No, perhaps not.
SOCRATES : But supposing it were the soul of one of us that he was b
praising? Suppose he said one of us was good and wise? Oughtn’t the
one who heard that to be very anxious to examine the object of such praise?
And oughtn’t the other to be very willing to show himself off?
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly, Socrates.
SOCRATES : Then, my dear Theaetetus, now is the time for you to show
yourself and for me to examine you. For although Theodorus often gives
meﬂattering testimonials for people, both Athenians and foreigners, I
assure you I have never before heard him praise anybody in the way he c
has just praised you.
THEAETETUS : That’s all very well, Socrates; but take care he wasn’t saying
that for a joke.
SOCRATES : That is not Theodorus’ way. Now don’t you try to get out of
what we have agreed upon with the pretence that our friend is joking, or
you may make it necessary for him to give his evidence —since no charge
of perjury is ever likely to be brought against him. So have the pluck to
stand by your agreement.
THEAETETUS : All right, I must, then, if that’s what you’ve decided.
SOCRATES : Tell me now. You are learning some geometry from Theodorus,
I expect?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I am.
SOCRATES : And some astronomy and music and arithmetic? d
THEAETETUS : Well, I’m very anxious to, anyway.
SOCRATES : And so am I, my son —from Theodorus or from anyone who
seems to me to know about these things. But although I get on with them
pretty well in most ways, I have a small difﬁculty, which I think ought to162 Theaetetus
be investigated, with your help and that of the rest of the company. —
Now isn’t it true that to learn is to become wiser1about the thing one
is learning?
THEAETETUS : Yes, of course.
SOCRATES : And what makes men wise, I take it, is wisdom?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : And is this in any way different from knowledge? e
THEAETETUS : What?
SOCRATES : Wisdom. Isn’t it the things which they know that men are
wise about?
THEAETETUS : Well, yes.
SOCRATES : So knowledge and wisdom will be the same thing?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Now this is just where my difﬁculty comes in. I can’t get a
proper grasp of what on earth knowledge really is. Could we manage to 146
put it into words? What do all of you say? Who’ll speak ﬁrst? Anyone
who makes a mistake shall sit down and be Donkey, as the children say
when they are playing ball; and anyone who comes through without a
miss shall be King and make us answer any question he likes. —Well, why
this silence? Theodorus, I hope my love of argument is not making me
forget my manners —just because I’m so anxious to start a discussion and
get us all friendly and talkative together?
THEODORUS : No, no, Socrates —that’s the last thing one could call forget- b
ting your manners. But do make one of the young people answer you. I
am not used to this kind of discussion, and I’m too old to get into the way
of it. But it would be suitable enough for them and they would proﬁt more
by it. For youth can always proﬁt, that’s true enough. So do go on; don’t
let Theaetetus off but ask him some more questions.
SOCRATES : Well, Theaetetus, you hear what Theodorus says. You won’t
want to disobey him, I’m sure; and certainly a wise man shouldn’tb e c
disobeyed by his juniors in matters of this kind —it wouldn’t be at all the
proper thing. Now give me a good frank answer. What do you think
knowledge is?
THEAETETUS : Well, I ought to answer, Socrates, as you and Theodorus
tell me to. In any case, you and he will put me right, if I make a mistake.
SOCRATES : We certainly will, if we can.
THEAETETUS : Then I think that the things Theodorus teaches are knowl-
edge —I mean geometry and the subjects you enumerated just now. Then d
again there are the crafts such as cobbling, whether you take them together
or separately. They must be knowledge, surely.
SOCRATES : That is certainly a frank and indeed a generous answer, my
dear lad. I asked you for one thing and you have given me many; I wanted
something simple, and I have got a variety.
1. The words ‘wise’ and ‘wisdom’ in the argument which begins here represent the
Greek sophos and sophia. The point of the argument will come across more naturally in
English if readers substitute in their mind the words ‘expert’ and ‘expertise’.Theaetetus 163
THEAETETUS : And what does that mean, Socrates?
SOCRATES : Nothing, I dare say. But I’ll tell you what I think. When you
talk about cobbling, you mean just knowledge of the making of shoes?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s all I mean by it.
SOCRATES : And when you talk about carpentering, you mean simply the e
knowledge of the making of wooden furniture?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s all I mean, again.
SOCRATES : And in both cases you are putting into your deﬁnition what
the knowledge is of?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But that is not what you were asked, Theaetetus. You were
not asked to say what one may have knowledge of, or how many branches
of knowledge there are. It was not with any idea of counting these up that
the question was asked; we wanted to know what knowledge itself is. —
Or am I talking nonsense?
THEAETETUS : No, you are perfectly right.
SOCRATES : Now think about this too. Supposing we were asked about 147
some commonplace, everyday thing; for example, what is clay? And sup-
posing we were to answer, ‘clay of the potters’ and‘clay of the stovemakers’
and ‘clay of the brickmakers’, wouldn’t that be absurd of us?
THEAETETUS : Well, perhaps it would.
SOCRATES : Absurd to begin with, I suppose, to imagine that the person
who asked the question would understand anything from our answer
when we say ‘clay’, whether we add that it is dollmakers’ clay or any b
other craftsman’s. Or do you think that anyone can understand the name
of a thing when he doesn’t know what the thing is?
THEAETETUS : No, certainly not.
SOCRATES : And so a man who does not know what knowledge is will
not understand ‘knowledge of shoes’ either?
THEAETETUS : No, he won’t.
SOCRATES : Then a man who is ignorant of what knowledge is will not
understand what cobbling is, or any other craft?
THEAETETUS : That is so.
SOCRATES : So when the question raised is ‘What is knowledge?’, to reply
by naming one of the crafts is an absurd answer; because it points out c
something that knowledge is of when this is not what the question was
about.
THEAETETUS : So it seems.
SOCRATES : Again, it goes no end of a long way round, in a case where,
I take it, a short and commonplace answer is possible. In the question
about clay, for example, it would presumably be possible to make the
simple, commonplace statement that it is earth mixed with liquid, and let
the question of whose clay it is take care of itself.
THEAETETUS : That seems easier, Socrates, now you put it like that. But I
believe you’re asking just the sort of question that occurred to your name- d
sake Socrates here and myself, when we were having a discussion a little
while ago.164 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : And what was that, Theaetetus?
THEAETETUS : Theodorus here was demonstrating to us with the aid of
diagrams a point about powers.2He was showing us that the power of three
square feet and the power of ﬁve square feet are not commensurable in length
with the power of one square foot; and he went on in this way, taking each
case in turn till he came to the power of seventeen square feet; there for some
reason he stopped. So the idea occurred to us that, since the powers were
turning out to be unlimited in number, we might try to collect the powers in
question under one term, which would apply to them all. e
SOCRATES : And did you ﬁnd the kind of thing you wanted?
THEAETETUS : I think we did. But I’d like you to see if it’s all right.
SOCRATES : Go on, then.
THEAETETUS : We divided all numbers into two classes. Any number
which can be produced by the multiplication of two equal numbers, we
compared to a square in shape, and we called this a square or equilat-
eral number.
SOCRATES : Good, so far.
THEAETETUS : Then we took the intermediate numbers, such as three and 148
ﬁve and any number which can’t be produced by multiplication of two
equals but only by multiplying together a greater and a less; a number
such that it is always contained by a greater and a less side. A number of
this kind we compared to an oblong ﬁgure, and called it an oblong number.
SOCRATES : That’s excellent. But how did you go on?
THEAETETUS :W ed e ﬁned under the term ‘length’ any line which produces
in square an equilateral plane number; while any line which produces in
square an oblong number we deﬁned under the term ‘power’, for the
reason that although it is incommensurable with the former in length, it b
is commensurable in the plane ﬁgures which they respectively have the
2.‘Powers’ is a mathematical term for squares. By contrast, at 148a –b‘power’ is given
a new, specially deﬁned use to denominate a species of line, viz. the incommensurable
lines for which the boys wanted a general account. It may be useful to give a brief
explanation of the mathematics of the passage.
Two lines are incommensurable if and only if they have no common measure; that
is, no unit of length will measure both without remainder. Two squares are incommensu-
rable in length if and only if their sides are incommensurable lines; the areas themselves
may still be commensurable, i.e., both measurable by some unit of area, as is mentioned
at 148b. When Theodorus showed for a series of powers (squares) that each is incommen-
surable in length with the one foot (unit) square, we can think of him as proving case
by case the irrationality of √3,√5 ,...√17. But this was not how he thought of it himself.
Greek mathematicians did not recognize irrational numbers but treated of irrational
quantities as geometrical entities: in this instance, lines identi ﬁed by the areas of the
squares that can be constructed on them. Similarly, we can think of the boys’ formula
for powers or square lines at 148a –b as making the point that, for any positive integer
n,√nis irrational if and only if there is no positive integer msuch that n=m ×m. But,
once again, a Greek mathematician would think of this generalization in the geometrical
terms in which Theaetetus expounds it.Theaetetus 165
power to produce. And there is another distinction of the same sort with
regard to solids.
SOCRATES : Excellent, my boys. I don’t think Theodorus is likely to be
had up for false witness.
THEAETETUS : And yet, Socrates, I shouldn’t be able to answer your ques-
tion about knowledge in the same way that I answered the one about
lengths and powers —though you seem to me to be looking for something
of the same sort. So Theodorus turns out a false witness after all.
SOCRATES : Well, but suppose now it was your running he had praised; c
suppose he had said that he had never met anyone among the young
people who was such a runner as you. And then suppose you were beaten
by the champion runner in his prime —would you think Theodorus’ praise
had lost any of its truth?
THEAETETUS : No, I shouldn’t.
SOCRATES : But do you think the discovery of what knowledge is is really
what I was saying just now —a small thing? Don’t you think that’sa
problem for the people at the top?
THEAETETUS : Yes, rather, I do; and the very topmost of them.
SOCRATES : Then do have conﬁdence in yourself and try to believe that
Theodorus knew what he was talking about. You must put your whole d
heart into what we are doing —in particular into this matter of getting a
statement of what knowledge really is.
THEAETETUS : If putting one’s heart into it is all that is required, Socrates,
the answer will come to light.
SOCRATES : Go on, then. You gave us a good lead just now. Try to imitate
your answer about the powers. There you brought together the many
powers within a single form; now I want you in the same way to give one
single account of the many branches of knowledge.
THEAETETUS : But I assure you, Socrates, I have often tried to think this e
out, when I have heard reports of the questions you ask. But I can never
persuade myself that anything I say will really do; and I never hear anyone
else state the matter in the way that you require. And yet, again, you
know, I can’t even stop worrying about it.
SOCRATES : Yes; those are the pains of labor, dear Theaetetus. It is because
you are not barren but pregnant.
THEAETETUS : I don’t know about that, Socrates. I’m only telling you
what’s happened to me.
SOCRATES : Then do you mean to say you’ve never heard about my being 149
the son of a good hefty midwife, Phaenarete?3
THEAETETUS : Oh, yes, I’ve heard that before.
SOCRATES : And haven’t you ever been told that I practice the same
art myself?
THEAETETUS : No, I certainly haven’t.
3. The name means ‘She who brings virtue to light’.166 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : But I do, believe me. Only don’t give me away to the rest of
the world, will you? You see, my friend, it is a secret that I have this art.
That is not one of the things you hear people saying about me, because
they don’t know; but they do say that I am a very odd sort of person, always
causing people to get into difﬁculties. You must have heard that, surely?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I have. b
SOCRATES : And shall I tell you what is the explanation of that?
THEAETETUS : Yes, please do.
SOCRATES : Well, if you will just think of the general facts about the
business of midwifery, you will see more easily what I mean. You know,
I suppose, that women never practice as midwives while they are still
conceiving and bearing children themselves. It is only those who are past
child-bearing who take this up.
THEAETETUS : Oh, yes.
SOCRATES : They say it was Artemis who was responsible for this custom;
it was because she, who undertook the patronage of childbirth, was herself c
childless. She didn’t, it’s true, entrust the duties of midwifery to barren
women, because human nature is too weak to acquire skill where it has
no experience. But she assigned the task to those who have become incapa-
ble of child-bearing through age —honoring their likeness to herself.
THEAETETUS : Yes, naturally.
SOCRATES : And this too is very natural, isn’t it? —or perhaps necessary?
I mean that it is the midwives who can tell better than anyone else whether
women are pregnant or not.
THEAETETUS : Yes, of course.
SOCRATES : And then it is the midwives who have the power to bring on d
the pains, and also, if they think ﬁt, to relieve them; they do it by the use
of simple drugs, and by singing incantations. In difﬁcult cases, too, they
can bring about the birth; or, if they consider it advisable, they can promote
a miscarriage.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that is so.
SOCRATES : There’s another thing too. Have you noticed this about them,
that they are the cleverest of match-makers, because they are marvellously
knowing about the kind of couples whose marriage will produce the
best children?
THEAETETUS : No, that is not at all familiar to me.
SOCRATES : But they are far prouder of this, believe me, than of cutting
the umbilical cord. Think now. There’s an art which is concerned with the e
cultivation and harvesting of the crops. Now is it the same art which
prescribes the best soil for planting or sowing a given crop? Or is it a
different one?
THEAETETUS : No, it is all the same art.
SOCRATES : Then applying this to women, will there be one art of the
sowing and another of the harvesting?
THEAETETUS : That doesn’t seem likely, certainly.Theaetetus 167
SOCRATES : No, it doesn’t. But there is also an unlawful and unscientiﬁc 150
practice of bringing men and women together, which we call procuring;
and because of that the midwives —a most august body of women —are
very reluctant to undertake even lawful matchmaking. They are afraid
that if they practice this, they may be suspected of the other. And yet, I
suppose, reliable matchmaking is a matter for no one but the true midwife.
THEAETETUS : Apparently.
SOCRATES : So the work of the midwives is a highly important one; but
it is not so important as my own performance. And for this reason, that
there is not in midwifery the further complication, that the patients are b
sometimes delivered of phantoms and sometimes of realities, and that the
two are hard to distinguish. If there were, then the midwife’s greatest and
noblest function would be to distinguish the true from the false offspring —
don’t you agree?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I do.
SOCRATES : Now my art of midwifery is just like theirs in most respects.
The difference is that I attend men and not women, and that I watch over
the labor of their souls, not of their bodies. And the most important thing c
about my art is the ability to apply all possible tests to the offspring, to
determine whether the young mind is being delivered of a phantom, that
is, an error, or a fertile truth. For one thing which I have in common with
the ordinary midwives is that I myself am barren of wisdom. The common
reproach against me is that I am always asking questions of other people
but never express my own views about anything, because there is no
wisdom in me; and that is true enough. And the reason of it is this, that
God compels me to attend the travail of others, but has forbidden me to
procreate. So that I am not in any sense a wise man; I cannot claim as the d
child of my own soul any discovery worth the name of wisdom. But with
those who associate with me it is different. At ﬁrst some of them may give
the impression of being ignorant and stupid; but as time goes on and our
association continues, all whom God permits are seen to make progress —
a progress which is amazing both to other people and to themselves. And
yet it is clear that this is not due to anything they have learned from me;
it is that they discover within themselves a multitude of beautiful things,
which they bring forth into the light. But it is I, with God’s help, who
deliver them of this offspring. And a proof of this may be seen in the e
many cases where people who did not realize this fact took all the credit
to themselves and thought that I was no good. They have then proceeded
to leave me sooner than they should, either of their own accord or through
the inﬂuence of others. And after they have gone away from me they have
resorted to harmful company, with the result that what remained within
them has miscarried; while they have neglected the children I helped them
to bring forth, and lost them, because they set more value upon lies and
phantoms than upon the truth; ﬁnally they have been set down for ignorant
fools, both by themselves and by everybody else. One of these people was 151168 Theaetetus
Aristides the son of Lysimachus;4and there have been very many others.
Sometimes they come back, wanting my company again, and ready to
move heaven and earth to get it. When that happens, in some cases the
divine sign that visits me forbids me to associate with them; in others, it
permits me, and then they begin again to make progress.
There is another point also in which those who associate with me are
like women in child-birth. They suffer the pains of labor, and are ﬁlled
day and night with distress; indeed they suffer far more than women. And
this pain my art is able to bring on, and also to allay.
Well, that’s what happens to them; but at times, Theaetetus, I come b
across people who do not seem to me somehow to be pregnant. Then I
realize that they have no need of me, and with the best will in the world
I undertake the business of match-making; and I think I am good enough —
God willing —at guessing with whom they might proﬁtably keep company.
Many of them I have given away to Prodicus;5and a great number also
to other wise and inspired persons.
Well, my dear lad, this has been a long yarn; but the reason was that I
have a suspicion that you (as you think yourself) are pregnant and in
labor. So I want you to come to me as to one who is both the son of a c
midwife and himself skilled in the art; and try to answer the questions I
shall ask you as well as you can. And when I examine what you say, I
may perhaps think it is a phantom and not truth, and proceed to take it
quietly from you and abandon it. Now if this happens, you mustn’t get
savage with me, like a mother over her ﬁrst-born child. Do you know,
people have often before now got into such a state with me as to be literally
ready to bite when I take away some nonsense or other from them. They
never believe that I am doing this in all goodwill; they are so far from
realizing that no God can wish evil to man, and that even I don’t do this d
kind of thing out of malice, but because it is not permitted to me to accept
a lie and put away truth.
So begin again, Theaetetus, and try to say what knowledge is. And don’t
on any account tell me that you can’t. For if God is willing, and you play
the man, you can.
THEAETETUS : Well, Socrates, after such encouragement from you, it would
hardly be decent for anyone not to try his hardest to say what he has in e
him. Very well then. It seems to me that a man who knows something
perceives what he knows, and the way it appears at present, at any rate,
is that knowledge is simply perception.
SOCRATES : There’s a good frank answer, my son. That’s the way to speak
one’s mind. But come now, let us look at this thing together, and see
whether what we have here is really fertile or a mere wind-egg. You hold
that knowledge is perception?
4. Aristides is one of the two young men whose education Socrates discusses in Laches
(see 178a –179b).
5. A famous Sophist. See Protagoras 315d, 337a –c, 340e –341c, 358a –b.Theaetetus 169
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But look here, this is no ordinary account of knowledge you’ve
come out with: it’s what Protagoras used to maintain. He said the very 152
same thing, only he put it in rather a different way. For he says, you know,
that ‘Man is the measure of all things: of the things which are, that they
are, and of the things which are not, that they are not.’ You have read
this, of course?
THEAETETUS : Yes, often.
SOCRATES : Then you know that he puts it something like this, that as
each thing appears to me, so it is for me, and as it appears to you, so it
is for you —you and I each being a man?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that is what he says.
SOCRATES : Well, it is not likely that a wise man would talk nonsense. So b
let us follow him up. Now doesn’t it sometimes happen that when the
same wind is blowing, one of us feels cold and the other not? Or that one
of us feels rather cold and the other very cold?
THEAETETUS : That certainly does happen.
SOCRATES : Well then, in that case are we going to say that the wind itself,
by itself, is cold or not cold? Or shall we listen to Protagoras, and say it
is cold for the one who feels cold, and for the other, not cold?
THEAETETUS : It looks as if we must say that.
SOCRATES : And this is how it appears to each of us?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But this expression ‘it appears’ means ‘he perceives it’?
THEAETETUS : Yes, it does.
SOCRATES : The appearing of things, then, is the same as perception, in c
the case of hot and things like that. So it results, apparently, that things
are for the individual such as he perceives them.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that seems all right.
SOCRATES : Perception, then, is always of what is, and unerring —as be-
ﬁts knowledge.
THEAETETUS : So it appears.
SOCRATES : But, I say, look here. Was Protagoras one of those omniscient
people? Did he perhaps put this out as a riddle for the common crowd of
us, while he revealed the Truth6as a secret doctrine to his own pupils?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean by that, Socrates? d
SOCRATES :I’ll tell you; and this, now, is certainly no ordinary theory —
I mean the theory that there is nothing which in itself is just one thing:
nothing which you could rightly call anything or any kind of thing. If you
call a thing large, it will reveal itself as small, and if you call it heavy, it
is liable to appear as light, and so on with everything, because nothing is
one or anything or any kind of thing. What is really true, is this: the things
of which we naturally say that they ’are’, are in process of coming to be, e
6. Protagoras of Abdera was a ﬁfth century B.C.philosopher and sophist; this appears
to have been the title of his book.170 Theaetetus
as the result of movement and change and blending with one another. We
are wrong when we say they ‘are’, since nothing ever is, but everything
is coming to be.
And as regards this point of view, let us take it as a fact that all the
wise men of the past, with the exception of Parmenides, stand together.
Let us take it that we ﬁnd on this side Protagoras and Heraclitus and
Empedocles; and also the masters of the two kinds of poetry, Epicharmus
in comedy and Homer in tragedy.7For when Homer talked about ‘Ocean,
begetter of gods, and Tethys their mother’, he made all things the offspring
ofﬂux and motion.8—Or don’t you think he meant that?
THEAETETUS : Oh, I think he did.
SOCRATES : And if anyone proceeded to dispute the ﬁeld with an army 153
like that —an army led by Homer —he could hardly help making a fool of
himself, could he?
THEAETETUS : It would not be an easy matter, Socrates.
SOCRATES : It would not, Theaetetus. You see, there is good enough evi-
dence for this theory that being (what passes for such) and becoming are
a product of motion, while not-being and passing-away result from a state
of rest. There is evidence for it in the fact that heat or ﬁre, which presumably
generates and controls everything else, is itself generated out of movement
and friction —these being motions. —Or am I wrong in saying these are
the original sources of ﬁre?
THEAETETUS : Oh no, they certainly are. b
SOCRATES : Moreover, the growth of living creatures depends upon these
same sources?
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly.
SOCRATES : And isn’t it also true that bodily condition deteriorates with
rest and idleness? While by exertion and motion it can be preserved for
a long time?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : And what about the condition of the soul? Isn’t it by learning
and study, which are motions, that the soul gains knowledge and is pre-
served9and becomes a better thing? Whereas in a state of rest, that is, c
when it will not study or learn, it not only fails to acquire knowledge but
forgets what it has already learned?
7. Heraclitus was famous for holding that ‘everything ﬂows’ (cf. 179d ff.). Empedocles
described a cosmic cycle in which things are constituted and dissolved by the coming
together and separating of the four elements earth, air, ﬁre, and water. Epicharmus made
humorous use of the idea that everything is always changing by having a debtor claim
he is not the same person as incurred the debt. Parmenides remains outside the chorus
of agreement because he held that the only reality is one single, completely changeless
thing (cf. 183e).
8.Iliad xiv.201, 302.
9. The Greek could equally be translated ‘that the soul gains and preserves knowledge’;
the reader may perhaps be expected to hear the clause both ways.Theaetetus 171
THEAETETUS : That certainly is so.
SOCRATES : And so we may say that the one thing, that is, motion, is
beneﬁcial to both body and soul, while the other has the opposite effect?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s what it looks like.
SOCRATES : Yes, and I might go on to point out to you the effect of such
conditions as still weather on land and calms on the sea. I might show you
how these conditions rot and destroy things, while the opposite conditions
make for preservation. And ﬁnally, to put the crown on my argument, I
might bring in Homer’s golden cord,10and maintain that he means by this
simply the sun; and is here explaining that so long as the revolution d
continues and the sun is in motion, all things are and are preserved, both
in heaven and in earth, but that if all this should be ‘bound fast’,a si t
were, and come to a standstill, all things would be destroyed and, as the
saying goes, the world would be turned upside down. Do you agree
with this?
THEAETETUS : Yes, Socrates, I think that is the meaning of the passage.
SOCRATES : Then, my friend, you must understand our theory in this way.
In the sphere of vision, to begin with, what you would naturally call a
white color is not itself a distinct entity, either outside your eyes or in e
your eyes. You must not assign it any particular place; for then, of course
it would be standing at its post; it wouldn’t be in process of becoming.
THEAETETUS : But what do you mean?
SOCRATES : Let us follow what we stated a moment ago, and posit that
there is nothing which is, in itself, one thing. According to this theory,
black or white or any other color will turn out to have come into being
through the impact of the eye upon the appropriate motion; and what we
naturally call a particular color is neither that which impinges nor that 154
which is impinged upon, but something which has come into being be-
tween the two, and which is private to the individual percipient. —Or
would you be prepared to insist that every color appears to a dog, or to
any other animal, the same as it appears to you?
THEAETETUS : No, I most certainly shouldn’t.
SOCRATES : Well, and do you even feel sure that anything appears to
another human being like it appears to you? Wouldn’t you be much more
disposed to hold that it doesn’t appear the same even to yourself because
you never remain like yourself?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that seems to me nearer the truth than the other.
SOCRATES : Well now, supposing such things as size or warmth or white- b
ness really belonged to the object we measure ourselves against or touch,
it would never be found that this object had become different simply by
coming into contact with another thing and without any change in itself.
On the other hand, if you suppose them to belong to what is measuring
10.Iliad viii.17 –27. Zeus boasts that if he pulled on a golden cord let down from heaven,
he could haul up earth, sea and all, bind the cord fast round the peak of Mt. Olympus,
and leave the lot dangling in mid-air.172 Theaetetus
or touching, this again could never become different simply because some-
thing else had come into its neighborhood, or because something had
happened to the ﬁrst thing —nothing having happened to itself. As it is,
you see, we may easily ﬁnd ourselves forced into saying the most astonish-
ing and ridiculous things, as Protagoras would point out or anyone who
undertook to expound the same views.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean? What sort of ridiculous things?
SOCRATES : Let me give you a simple example of what I mean, and you c
will see the rest for yourself. Here are six dice. Put four beside them, and
they are more, we say, than the four, that is, half as many again; but put
twelve beside them, and we say they are less, that is, half the number.
And there is no getting out of that —or do you think there is?
THEAETETUS : No, I don’t.
SOCRATES : Well now, supposing Protagoras or anyone else were to ask
you this question: ‘Is it possible, Theaetetus, for any thing to become bigger
or more in number in any other way than by being increased?’ What is d
your answer to that?
THEAETETUS : Well, Socrates, if I answer what seems true in relation to
the present question, I shall say ‘No, it is not possible’; but if I consider
it in relation to the question that went before, then in order to avoid
contradicting myself, I say ‘Yes, it is.’
SOCRATES : That’s a good answer, my friend, by Jove it is; you are inspired.
But, I think, if you answer ‘Yes’, it will be like that episode in Euripides —
the tongue will be safe from refutation but the mind will not.11
THEAETETUS : That’s true.
SOCRATES : Now if you and I were professional savants, who had already
analyzed all the contents of our minds, we should now spend our super-
ﬂuous time trying each other out; we should start a regular Sophists ’set- e
to, with a great clashing of argument on argument. But, as it is, we are
only plain men; and so our ﬁrst aim will be to look at our thoughts
themselves in relation to themselves, and see what they are —whether, in
our opinion, they agree with one another or are entirely at variance.
THEAETETUS : That would certainly be my aim, anyway.
SOCRATES : And mine. That being so, as we are not in any way pressed
for time, don’t you think the thing to do is to reconsider this matter quietly 155
and patiently, in all seriousness ‘analyzing’ ourselves, and asking what
are these apparitions within us? —And when we come to review them, I
suppose we may begin with the statement that nothing can possibly have
become either greater or less, in bulk or in number, so long as it is equal
to itself. Isn’t that so?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Secondly, we should say that a thing to which nothing is added
and from which nothing is taken away neither increases nor diminishes but
remains equal.
11. Cf. Hippolytus 612.Theaetetus 173
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly.
SOCRATES : Thirdly, that it is impossible that a thing should ever be b
what it was not before without having become and without any process
of becoming?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I think so.
SOCRATES : Now it seems to me that these three statements that we have
admitted are ﬁghting one another in our souls when we speak of the
example of the dice; or when we say that, within the space of a year, I (a
full-grown man) without having been either increased or diminished, am
now bigger than you (who are only a boy) and, later on, smaller —though
I have lost nothing and it is only that you have grown. For this means c
that I am, at a later stage, what I was not before, and that, too, without
having become —for without becoming it is not possible to have become,
and without suffering any loss in size I could never become less. And
there are innumerable other examples of the same thing if once we admit
these. You follow me, I take it, Theaetetus —I think you must be familiar
with this kind of puzzle.
THEAETETUS : Oh yes, indeed, Socrates, I often wonder like mad what
these things can mean; sometimes when I’m looking at them I begin to
feel quite giddy.
SOCRATES : I dare say you do, my dear boy. It seems that Theodorus was d
not far from the truth when he guessed what kind of person you are. For
this is an experience which is characteristic of a philosopher, this wonder-
ing: this is where philosophy begins and nowhere else. And the man who
made Iris the child of Thaumas was perhaps no bad genealogist.12—But
aren’t you beginning to see now what is the explanation of these puzzles,
according to the theory which we are attributing to Protagoras?
THEAETETUS : I don’t think I am, yet.
SOCRATES : Then I dare say you will be grateful to me if I help you to e
discover the veiled truth in the thought of a great man —or perhaps I
should say, of great men?
THEAETETUS : Of course I shall be, Socrates, very grateful.
SOCRATES : Then you have a look round, and see that none of the uniniti-
ated are listening to us —I mean the people who think that nothing exists
but what they can grasp with both hands; people who refuse to admit
that actions and processes and the invisible world in general have any
place in reality.
THEAETETUS : They must be tough, hard fellows, Socrates. 156
SOCRATES : They are, my son —very crude people. But these others, whose
mysteries I am going to tell you, are a much more subtle type. These
mysteries begin from the principle on which all that we have just been
saying also depends, namely, that everything is really motion, and there
is nothing but motion. Motion has two forms, each an inﬁnite multitude,
12.Theogony 265. ‘Thaumas’ means wonder, while Iris, the messenger of the gods, is
the rainbow which passes between earth and heaven.174 Theaetetus
but distinguished by their powers, the one being active and the other
passive. And through the intercourse and mutual friction of these two
there comes to be an offspring inﬁnite in multitude but always twin births, b
on the one hand what is perceived, on the other, the perception of it, the
perception in every case being generated together with what is perceived
and emerging along with it. For the perceptions we have such names as
sight, hearing, smelling, feeling cold and feeling hot; also what are called
pleasures and pains, desires and fears; and there are others besides, a great
number which have names, an inﬁnite number which have not. And on
the other side there is the race of things perceived, for each of these
perceptions perceived things born of the same parentage, for all kinds of c
visions all kinds of colors, for all kinds of hearings all kinds of sounds;
and so on, for the other perceptions the other things perceived, that come
to be in kinship with them.
Now what does this tale really mean, from our point of view, Theaetetus?
How does it bear on what we were saying before? Do you see?
THEAETETUS : Not really, Socrates.
SOCRATES : Look here, then, let us see if we can somehow round it off.
What it is trying to express, presumably, is this. All these things are in
motion, just as we say; and their motion is distinguished by its swiftness
or slowness. What is slow has its motion in one and the same place, and
in relation to the things in the immediate neighborhood; in this way it d
generates and the offspring are swifter, as they move through space, and
their motion takes the form of spatial movement.
Thus the eye and some other thing —one of the things commensurate
with the eye —which has come into its neighborhood, generate both white-
ness and the perception which is by nature united with it (things which
would never have come to be if it had been anything else that eye or object
approached). In this event, motions arise in the intervening space, sight e
from the side of the eye and whiteness from the side of that which cooper-
ates in the production of the color. The eye is ﬁlled with sight; at that
moment it sees, and becomes not indeed sight, but a seeing eye; while its
partner in the process of producing color is ﬁlled with whiteness, and
becomes not whiteness but white, a white stick or stone or whatever it is
that happens to be colored this sort of color.
We must understand this account as applying in the same way to hard 157
and hot and everything else: nothing, as we were saying before, isin itself
any of these. All of them, of all kinds whatsoever, are what things become
through association with one another, as the result of motion. For even in
the case of the active and passive motions it is impossible, as they say, for
thought, taking them singly, to pin them down to being anything. There
is no passive till it meets the active, no active except in conjunction with
the passive; and what, in conjunction with one thing, is active, reveals
itself as passive when it falls in with something else.
And so, wherever you turn, there is nothing, as we said at the outset,
which in itself is just one thing; all things become relatively to something. bTheaetetus 175
The verb ‘to be’ must be totally abolished —though indeed we have been
led by habit and ignorance into using it ourselves more than once, even
in what we have just been saying. That is wrong, these wise men tell us,
nor should we allow the use of such words as ‘something’, ‘of something’,
or‘mine’, ‘this’ or‘that’, or any other name that makes things stand still.
We ought, rather, to speak according to nature and refer to things as
‘becoming’, ‘being produced’, ‘passing away’, ‘changing’; for if you speak
in such a way as to make things stand still, you will easily be refuted.
And this applies in speaking both of the individual case and of many
aggregated together —such an aggregate, I mean, as people call ‘man’ or c
‘stone’, or to which they give the names of the different animals and sorts
of thing.
—Well, Theaetetus, does this look to you a tempting meal and could
you take a bite of the delicious stuff?
THEAETETUS : I really don’t know, Socrates. I can’t even quite see what
you’re getting at —whether the things you are saying are what you think
yourself, or whether you are just trying me out.
SOCRATES : You are forgetting, my friend. I don’t know anything about
this kind of thing myself, and I don’t claim any of it as my own. I am
barren of theories; my business is to attend you in your labor. So I chant
incantations over you and offer you little tidbits from each of the wise till d
I succeed in assisting you to bring your own belief forth into the light.
When it has been born, I shall consider whether it is fertile or a wind-egg.
But you must have courage and patience; answer like a man whatever
appears to you about the things I ask you.
THEAETETUS : All right, go on with the questions.
SOCRATES : Tell me again, then, whether you like the suggestion that good
and beautiful and all the things we were just speaking of cannot be said
to‘be’ anything, but are always ‘coming to be’.13
THEAETETUS : Well, as far as I’m concerned, while I’m listening to your
exposition of it, it seems to me an extraordinarily reasonable view; and I
feel that the way you have set out the matter has got to be accepted.
SOCRATES : In that case, we had better not pass over any point where our e
theory is still incomplete. What we have not yet discussed is the question
of dreams, and of insanity and other diseases; also what is called mishearing
or misseeing or other cases of misperceiving. You realize, I suppose, that
it would be generally agreed that all these cases appear to provide a
refutation of the theory we have just expounded. For in these conditions, 158
we surely have false perceptions. Here it is far from being true that all
things which appear to the individual also are. On the contrary, no one
of the things which appear to him really is.
THEAETETUS : That is perfectly true, Socrates.
13. An alternative translation would be: ‘the suggestion that nothing is, but rather
becomes, good, beautiful or any of the things we were speaking of just now ’.176 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : Well then, my lad, what argument is left for the person who
maintains that knowledge is perception and that what appears to any
individual also is, for him to whom it appears to be?
THEAETETUS : Well, Socrates, I hardly like to tell you that I don’t know
what to say, seeing I’ve just got into trouble with you for that. But I really b
shouldn’t know how to dispute the suggestion that a madman believes
what is false when he thinks he is a god; or a dreamer when he imagines
he has wings and is ﬂying in his sleep.
SOCRATES : But there’s a point here which isa matter of dispute, especially
as regards dreams and real life —don’t you see?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
SOCRATES : There’s a question you must often have heard people ask —
the question what evidence we could offer if we were asked whether in
the present instance, at this moment, we are asleep and dreaming all our c
thoughts, or awake and talking to each other in real life.
THEAETETUS : Yes, Socrates, it certainly is difﬁcult to ﬁnd the proof we
want here. The two states seem to correspond in all their characteristics.
There is nothing to prevent us from thinking when we are asleep that we
are having the very same discussion that we have just had. And when we
dream that we are telling the story of a dream, there is an extraordinary
likeness between the two experiences.
SOCRATES : You see, then, it is not difﬁcult to ﬁnd matter for dispute,
when it is disputed even whether this is real life or a dream. Indeed we d
may say that, as our periods of sleeping and waking are of equal length,
and as in each period the soul contends that the beliefs of the moment are
preeminently true, the result is that for half our lives we assert the reality
of the one set of objects, and for half that of the other set. And we make
our assertions with equal conviction in both cases.
THEAETETUS : That certainly is so.
SOCRATES : And doesn’t the same argument apply in the cases of disease
and madness, except that the periods of time are not equal?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that is so.
SOCRATES : Well now, are we going to ﬁx the limits of truth by the clock?
THEAETETUS : That would be a very funny thing to do. e
SOCRATES : But can you produce some other clear indication to show
which of these beliefs are true?
THEAETETUS : I don’t think I can.
SOCRATES : Then you listen to me and I’ll tell you the kind of thing that
might be said by those people who propose it as a rule that whatever a
man thinks at any time is the truth for him. I can imagine them putting
their position by asking you this question: ‘Now, Theaetetus, suppose you
have something which is an entirely different thing from something else.
Can it have in any respect the same powers as the other thing? ’And
observe, we are not to understand the question to refer to something which
is the same in some respects while it is different in others, but to that
which is wholly different.Theaetetus 177
THEAETETUS : In that case, then, it is impossible that it should have any- 159
thing the same, either as regards its powers or in any other respect, if it
is a completely different thing.
SOCRATES : And aren’t we obliged to admit that such a thing is also unlike
the other?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I think so.
SOCRATES : Now supposing a thing is coming to be like or unlike to
something, whether to itself or to something else; are we to say that when
it is growing like it is coming to be the same, and when it is growing
unlike it is coming to be a different thing?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that must be so.
SOCRATES : Now weren’t we saying, at an earlier stage, that there is a
number —indeed an inﬁnite number —of both active and passive factors?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Also this, that when a thing mixes now with one thing and
now with another, it will not generate the same things each time but
different things?
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly. b
SOCRATES : Well, now let us apply this same statement to you and me
and things in general. Take, for example, Socrates ill and Socrates well.
Shall we say Socrates in health is like or unlike Socrates in sickness?
THEAETETUS : You mean the ill Socrates as a whole compared with the
well Socrates as a whole?
SOCRATES : You get my point excellently; that is just what I mean.
THEAETETUS : Unlike, then, I suppose.
SOCRATES : And different also, in so far as he is unlike?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that follows.
SOCRATES : Similarly, you would say, when he is asleep or in any of the c
conditions we enumerated just now?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I should.
SOCRATES : Then it must surely be true that, when any one of the naturally
active factors ﬁnds Socrates well, it will be dealing with one me, and when
itﬁnds Socrates ill, with a different me?
THEAETETUS : Yes, surely.
SOCRATES : Then in these two events the combination of myself as passive
and it as the active factor will generate different things?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
SOCRATES : Now if I drink wine when I am well, it appears to me pleasant
and sweet?
THEAETETUS : Yes. d
SOCRATES : Going by what we earlier agreed, that is so because the active
and passive factors, moving simultaneously, generate both sweetness and a
perception; on the passive side, the perception makes the tongue percipient,
while on the side of the wine, sweetness moving about it makes it both
be and appear sweet to the healthy tongue.
THEAETETUS : That’s certainly the sense of what we agreed to before.178 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : But when the active factor ﬁnds Socrates ill, then, to begin
with, it is not in strict truth the same man that it gets hold of, is it? Because
here, as we saw, it has come upon an unlike.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Then this pair, Socrates ill and the draft of wine, generates, e
presumably, different things again: a perception of bitterness in the region
of the tongue, and bitterness coming to be and moving in the region of
the wine. And then the wine becomes, not bitterness, but bitter; and I
become, not perception, but percipient.
THEAETETUS : Yes, quite.
SOCRATES : And I shall never again become thus percipient of anything
else. A perception of something else is another perception, and makes 160
another and a changed percipient. Nor again, in the case of that which
acts on me, will it ever, in conjunction with something else, generate the
same thing and itself become such as it now is. From something else it
will generate something else, and itself become a changed thing.
THEAETETUS : That is so.
SOCRATES : Nor will I become such for myself or it such for itself.
THEAETETUS : No.
SOCRATES : But I must necessarily become percipient of something when
I become percipient; it is impossible to become percipient, yet percipient b
of nothing. And it again, when it becomes sweet or bitter or anything of
that kind, must become so for somebody, because it is impossible to become
sweet and yet sweet for no one.
THEAETETUS : Quite impossible.
SOCRATES : It remains, then, that I and it, whether we are or whether we
become, are or become for each other. For our being is, by Necessity’s
decree, tied to a partner; yet we are tied neither to any other thing in the
world nor to our respective selves. It remains, then, that we are tied to
each other. Hence, whether you apply the term ‘being’ to a thing or the
term ‘becoming’, you must always use the words ‘for somebody’ or‘of
something’ or‘relatively to something’. You must not speak of anything
as in itself either being or becoming nor let anyone else use such expres- c
sions. That is the meaning of the theory we have been expounding.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s certainly true, Socrates.
SOCRATES : Then since that which acts on me is for me, and not for anyone
else, it is I who perceive it too, and nobody else?
THEAETETUS : Undoubtedly.
SOCRATES : Then my perception is true for me —because it is always a
perception of that being which is peculiarly mine; and I am judge, as
Protagoras said, of things that are, that they are, for me; and of things that
are not, that they are not.
THEAETETUS : So it seems.
SOCRATES : How then, if I am thus unerring and never stumble in my d
thought about what is —or what is coming to be —how can I fail to be a
knower of the things of which I am a perceiver?
THEAETETUS : There is no way you could fail.Theaetetus 179
SOCRATES : Then that was a grand idea of yours when you told us that
knowledge is nothing more or less than perception. So we ﬁnd the various
theories have converged to the same thing: that of Homer and Heraclitus
and all their tribe, that all things ﬂow like streams; of Protagoras, wisest
of men, that man is the measure of all things; and of Theaetetus that, e
these things being so, knowledge proves to be perception. What about it,
Theaetetus? Shall we say we have here your ﬁrst-born child, the result of
my midwifery? Or what would you say?
THEAETETUS : Oh, there’s no denying it, Socrates.
SOCRATES : This, then, it appears, is what our efforts have at last brought
forth —whatever it really is. And now that it has been born, we must
perform the rite of running round the hearth with it; we must make it in
good earnest go the round of discussion. For we must take care that we
don’t overlook some defect in this thing that is entering into life; it may
be something not worth bringing up, a wind-egg, a falsehood. What do 161
you say? Is it your opinion that your child ought in any case to be brought
up and not exposed to die? Can you bear to see it found fault with, and
not get into a rage if your ﬁrst-born is stolen away from you?
THEODORUS : Theaetetus will put up with it, Socrates. He is not at all one
to lose his temper. But tell me, in Heaven’s name, in what way is it not
as it should be?
SOCRATES : You are the complete lover of discussion, Theodorus, and it
is too good of you to think that I am a sort of bag of arguments, and
can easily pick one out which will show you that this theory is wrong. b
But you don’t realize what is happening. The arguments never come from
me; they always come from the person I am talking to. All that I know,
such as it is, is how to take an argument from someone else —someone
who iswise —and give it a fair reception. So, now, I propose to try
to get our answer out of Theaetetus, not to make any contribution of
my own.
THEODORUS : That’s a better way of putting it, Socrates; do as you say.
SOCRATES : Well then, Theodorus, do you know what astonishes me about
your friend Protagoras?
THEODORUS :N o —what is it? c
SOCRATES : Well, I was delighted with his general statement of the theory
that a thing is for any individual what it seems to him to be; but I was
astonished at the way he began. I was astonished that he did not state at
the beginning of the Truth that ‘Pig is the measure of all things’ or‘Baboon’
or some yet more out-of-the-way creature with the power of perception.
That would have made a most imposing and disdainful opening. It would
have made it clear to us at once that, while we were standing astounded
at his wisdom as though he were a god, he was in reality no better authority d
than a tadpole —let alone any other man.
Or what are we to say, Theodorus? If whatever the individual judges
by means of perception is true for him; if no man can assess another’s
experience better than he, or can claim authority to examine another man’s
judgment and see if it be right or wrong; if, as we have repeatedly said,180 Theaetetus
only the individual himself can judge of his own world, and what he
judges is always true and correct: how could it ever be, my friend, that
Protagoras was a wise man, so wise as to think himself ﬁt to be the teacher e
of other men and worth large fees; while we, in comparison with him the
ignorant ones, needed to go and sit at his feet —we who are ourselves
each the measure of his own wisdom? Can we avoid the conclusion that
Protagoras was just playing to the crowd when he said this? I say nothing
about my own case and my art of midwifery and how silly we look. So
too, I think, does the whole business of philosophical discussion. To exam-
ine and try to refute each other’s appearances and judgments, when each
person’s are correct —this is surely an extremely tiresome piece of nonsense, 162
if the Truth of Protagoras is true, and not merely an oracle speaking in
jest from the impenetrable sanctuary of the book.
THEODORUS : Protagoras was my friend, Socrates, as you have just re-
marked. I could not consent to have him refuted through my admissions;
and yet I should not be prepared to resist you against my own judgment.
So take on Theaetetus again. He seemed to be following you very sympa-
thetically just now.
SOCRATES : Now, Theodorus, supposing you went to Sparta and were b
visiting the wrestling-schools. Would you think it right to sit and watch
other men exercising naked —some of them not much to look at —and
refuse to strip yourself alongside of them, and take your turn of letting
people see what you look like?
THEODORUS : Why not, if I could persuade them to leave the choice to
me? Similarly I am hoping to persuade you to allow me to be a spectator
and not drag me into the arena now that I am grown stiff; but to take on
someone who is younger and more supple.
SOCRATES : Well, Theodorus, what you like I’ll not dislike, as the saying
goes. So we must again resort to our wise Theaetetus. Come, Theaetetus. c
Think, to begin with, of what we have just been saying, and tell me if you
are not yourself astonished at suddenly ﬁnding that you are the equal in
wisdom of any man or even a god? —Or do you think the Protagorean
measure isn’t meant to be applied to gods as much as to men?
THEAETETUS : I most certainly don’t. And, to answer your question, yes,
I am very much astonished. When we were working out the meaning of d
the principle that a thing is for each man what it seems to him to be, it
appeared to me a very sound one. But now, all in a minute, it is quite the
other way round.
SOCRATES : Yes, because you are young, dear lad; and so you lend a ready
ear to mob-oratory and let it convince you. For Protagoras, or anyone
speaking on his behalf, will answer us like this: ‘My good people, young
and old,’ he will say, ‘you sit here orating; you drag in gods, whose e
existence or nonexistence I exclude from all discussion, written or spoken;14
14. A reference to a notorious declaration by Protagoras (Diog. Laert. 9.51): ‘Concerning
gods I am unable to know whether they exist or do not exist, or what they are like inTheaetetus 181
you keep on saying whatever is likely to be acceptable to the mob, telling
them that it would be a shocking thing if no man were wiser than any
cow in a ﬁeld; but of proof or necessity not a word. You just rely on
plausibility; though if Theodorus or any other geometer were to do that
in his branch of science, it’s a good-for-nothing geometer he would be’.
So you and Theodorus had better consider whether, in matters of such
importance, you are going to accept arguments which are merely persua- 163
sive or plausible.
THEAETETUS : You wouldn’t say we had any business to do that, Socrates;
and neither should we.
SOCRATES : Then, it seems, you and Theodorus say our criticism should
take a different line?
THEAETETUS : Yes, it certainly should.
SOCRATES : Here, then, is another way in which we might consider whether
knowledge and perception are the same or different things —for that is
the question which our argument has held in view throughout, isn’t it?
And it was for its sake that we have unearthed all this extraordinary stuff?
THEAETETUS : Undoubtedly.
SOCRATES : Well, now, are we going to agree that when we perceive things b
by seeing or hearing them, we always at the same time know them? Take,
for example, the case of hearing people speaking a foreign language which
we have not yet learned. Are we going to say that we do not hear the
sound of their voices when they speak? Or that we both hear it and know
what they are saying? Again, supposing we do not know our letters, are
we going to insist that we do not see them when we look at them? Or
shall we maintain that, if we see them, we know them?
THEAETETUS : We shall say, Socrates, that we know just that in them which
we see and hear. We both see and know the shape and the color of the
letters; and with the spoken words we both hear and know the rise and c
fall of the voice. But what schoolmasters and interpreters tell us about
them, we don’t perceive by seeing or hearing, and we don’t know, either.
SOCRATES : Very good indeed, Theaetetus; and it would not be right for
me to stand in the way of your progress by raising objections to what you
say. But look, there is another difﬁculty coming upon us. You must think
now how we are going to fend it off.
THEAETETUS : What kind of difﬁculty?
SOCRATES : I mean something like this. Supposing you were asked, ‘If a d
man has once come to know a certain thing, and continues to preserve
the memory of it, is it possible that, at the moment when he remembers
it, he doesn’t know this thing that he is remembering?’ But I am being
long-winded, I’m afraid. What I am trying to ask is, ‘Can a man who has
learned something not know it when he is remembering it?’
THEAETETUS : How could that happen, Socrates? That would be a most
extraordinary thing.
form; for there are many hindrances to knowledge, the obscurity of the subject and the
brevity of human life’.182 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : Then am I perhaps talking nonsense? But think now. You say
that seeing is perceiving and sight is perception?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Then a man who has seen something has come to know that e
which he saw, according to the statement you made just now?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But you do say —don’t you? —that there is such a thing as
memory?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Memory of nothing? Or of something?
THEAETETUS : Of something, surely.
SOCRATES : That is to say, of things which one has learned, that is, per-
ceived —that kind of ‘something’?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
SOCRATES : And what a man has once seen, he recalls, I take it, from time
to time?
THEAETETUS : He does.
SOCRATES : Even if he shuts his eyes? Or does he forget it if he does this?
THEAETETUS : That would be a strange thing to say, Socrates.
SOCRATES : Yet it is what we must say, if we are to save our previous 164
statement. Otherwise, it’s all up with it.
THEAETETUS : Yes, by Jove, I begin to have my suspicions too; but I don’t
quite see it yet. You explain.
SOCRATES : This is why. According to us, the man who sees has acquired
knowledge of what he sees, as sight, perception and knowledge are agreed
to be the same thing.
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly.
SOCRATES : But the man who sees and has acquired knowledge of the
thing he saw, if he shuts his eyes remembers but does not see it. Isn’t that so?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But to say ‘He doesn’t see’ is to say ‘He doesn’t know’,i f b
‘sees’ is‘knows’?
THEAETETUS : True.
SOCRATES : Then we have this result, that a man who has come to know
something and still remembers it doesn’t know it because he doesn’t see
it? And that’s what we said would be a most extraordinary thing to happen.
THEAETETUS : That’s perfectly true.
SOCRATES : Then apparently we get an impossible result when knowledge
and perception are identiﬁed?
THEAETETUS : It looks like it.
SOCRATES : Then we have got to say that perception is one thing and
knowledge another?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I’m afraid so.
SOCRATES : Then what isknowledge? We shall have to begin again at the c
beginning, it seems. And yet —whatever are we thinking about, Theaetetus?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?Theaetetus 183
SOCRATES : We appear to be behaving like a base-born ﬁghting-cock,
jumping away off the theory, and crowing before we have the victory
over it.
THEAETETUS : How are we doing that?
SOCRATES : We seem to have been adopting the methods of professional
controversialists: we’ve made an agreement aimed at getting words to
agree consistently; and we feel complacent now that we have defeated the
theory by the use of a method of this kind. We profess to be philosophers,
not champion controversialists; and we don’t realize that we are doing d
just what those clever fellows do.
THEAETETUS : I still don’t quite see what you mean.
SOCRATES : Well, I will try to explain what I have in mind here. We were
enquiring into the possibility that a man should not know something that
he has learned and remembers. And we showed that a man who has seen
something, and then shuts his eyes, remembers but does not see it; and
that showed that he does not know the thing at the very time that he
remembers it. We said that this was impossible. And so the tale of Protag-
oras comes to an untimely end; yours too, your tale about the identity of
knowledge and perception.
THEAETETUS : So it appears. e
SOCRATES : But I don’t think this would have happened, my friend, if the
father of the other tale were alive. He would ﬁnd plenty of means of
defending it. As things are, it is an orphan we are trampling in the mud.
Not even the people Protagoras appointed its guardians are prepared to
come to its rescue; for instance, Theodorus here. In the interests of justice,
it seems that we shall have to come to the rescue ourselves.
THEODORUS : I think you must. It is not I, you know, Socrates, but Callias, 165
the son of Hipponicus,15who is the guardian of Protagoras’ relicts. As it
happened, I very soon inclined away from abstract discussion to geometry.
But I shall be very grateful if you can rescue the orphan.
SOCRATES : Good, Theodorus. Now will you give your mind to this rescue
work of mine —what little I can do? Because one might be driven into
making even more alarming admissions than we have just made, if one
paid as little attention to the words in which we express our assertions
and denials as we are for the most part accustomed to doing. Shall I tell
you how this might happen? Or shall I tell Theaetetus?
THEODORUS : Tell us both, Socrates; but the younger had better answer.
It will not be so undigniﬁed for him to get tripped up. b
SOCRATES : Well, then, here is the most alarming poser of all. It goes
something like this, I think: ‘Is it possible for a man who knows something
not to know this thing which he knows?’
15. A wealthy Athenian famous for his patronage of the sophists: ‘a man who has spent
more money on sophists than everyone else put together ’(Apology 20a). The discussion
of Plato’s Protagoras is set in his house, where Protagoras and other visiting sophists
are staying.184 Theaetetus
THEODORUS : What are we going to answer now, Theaetetus?
THEAETETUS : That it is impossible, I should think.
SOCRATES : But it is not, if you are going to premise that seeing is knowing.
For what are you going to do when some intrepid fellow has you ‘trapped
in the well-shaft’, as they say, with a question that leaves you no way out:
clapping his hand over one of your eyes, he asks you whether you see his c
cloak with the eye that is covered —how will you cope with that?
THEAETETUS : I shall say that I don’t see it with this one, but I do with
the other.
SOCRATES : So you both see and do not see the same thing at the same time?
THEAETETUS : Well, yes, in that sort of way I do.
SOCRATES :‘That’s not the question I’m setting you,’ he will say, ‘I was
not asking you in what way it happened. I was asking you “Does it happen
that you don’t know what you know?” You now appear to be seeing what
you don’t see; and you have actually admitted that seeing is knowing,
and not to see is not to know. I leave you to draw your conclusion.’
THEAETETUS : Well, I draw a conclusion that contradicts my original sup- d
positions.
SOCRATES : And that is the kind of thing that might have happened to
you more than once, you wonderful fellow. It might have happened if
someone had gone on asking you whether it was possible to know some-
times clearly and sometimes dimly; or to know near at hand and not from
a distance; or to know the same thing both intensely and slightly. And
there are a million other questions with which one of the mercenary skir-
mishers of debate might ambush you, once you had proposed that knowl-
edge and perception are the same thing. He would lay into hearing and
smelling and other perceptions of that kind; and would keep on refuting
you and not let you go till you had been struck with wonder at his e
wisdom —that ‘answer to many prayers’—and had got yourself thoroughly
tied up by him. Then, when he had you tamed and bound, he would set
you free for a ransom —whatever price seemed appropriate to the two
of you.
But perhaps you’ll ask, what argument would Protagoras himself bring
to the help of his offspring. Shall we try to state it?
THEAETETUS : Yes, surely.
SOCRATES : Well, he will say all the things that we are saying in our
attempt to defend him; and then, I imagine, he will come to grips with 166
us, and in no respectful spirit either. I imagine him saying: ‘This good
Socrates here —what he did was to frighten a small boy by asking him if
it were possible that the same man should at once remember and not know
the same thing; and when the boy in his fright answered “No,” because
he couldn’t see what was coming, then, according to Socrates, the laugh
was against mein the argument. You are too easy-going, Socrates. The
true position is this. When you are examining any doctrine of mine by the
method of question and answer, if the person being questioned answers
as I myself would answer, and gets caught, then it is I who am refuted;Theaetetus 185
but if his answers are other than I should give, then it is he who is put in b
the wrong.
‘Now, to begin with, do you expect someone to grant you that a man
has a present memory of things he experienced in the past, this being an
experience rather like the original one, unless he is still experiencing them?
That is very far from being true. Again, do you suppose he will hesitate
to admit that it is possible for the same man to know and not know the
same thing? Or—if he has misgivings about this—do you expect him to
concede to you that the man, who is in process of becoming unlike, is the
same as he was before the process began? Do you expect him even to
speak of “the man” rather than of “the men,” indeed of an inﬁnite number
of these men coming to be in succession, assuming this process of becoming
unlike? Not if we really must take every precaution against each other’s c
verbal traps. Show a little more spirit, my good man,’ he will say, ‘and
attack my actual statement itself, and refute it, if you can, by showing that
each man’s perceptions are not his own private events; or that, if they are
his own private events, it does not follow that the thing which appears
“becomes” or, if we may speak of being, “is” only for the man to whom
it appears. You keep talking about pigs and baboons; you show the mental-
ity of a pig yourself, in the way you deal with my writings, and you
persuade your audience to follow your example. That is not the way d
to behave.
‘I take my stand on the truth being as I have written it. Each one of us
is the measure both of what is and of what is not; but there are countless
differences between men for just this very reason, that different things
both are and appear to be to different subjects. I certainly do not deny the
existence of both wisdom and wise men: far from it. But the man whom
I call wise is the man who can change the appearances—the man who in
any case where bad things both appear and are for one of us, works a
change and makes good things appear and be for him.
‘And I must beg you, this time, not to conﬁne your attack to the letter e
of my doctrine. I am now going to make its meaning clearer to you. For
instance, I would remind you of what we were saying before, namely,
that to the sick man the things he eats both appear and are bitter, while
to the healthy man they both appear and are the opposite. Now what we
have to do is not to make one of these two wiser than the other—that is 167
not even a possibility—nor is it our business to make accusations, calling
the sick man ignorant for judging as he does, and the healthy man wise,
because he judges differently. What we have to do is to make a change
from the one to the other, because the other state is better. In education,
too, what we have to do is to change a worse state into a better state; only
whereas the doctor brings about the change by the use of drugs, the
professional teacher16does it by the use of words. What never happens is
that a man who judges what is false is made to judge what is true. For it
16. Literally, ‘the sophist’.186 Theaetetus
is impossible to judge what is not, or to judge anything other than what one
is immediately experiencing; and what one is immediately experiencing is b
always true. This, in my opinion, is what really happens: when a man’s
soul is in a pernicious state, he judges things akin to it, but giving him a
sound state of the soul causes him to think different things, things that
are good. In the latter event, the things which appear to him are what
some people, who are still at a primitive stage, call “true”; my position,
however, is that the one kind are better than the others, but in no way truer.
‘Nor, my dear Socrates, should I dream of suggesting that we might
look for wisdom among frogs. I look for wisdom, as regards animal bodies,
in doctors; as regards plant-life, in gardeners —for I am quite prepared to
maintain that gardeners too, when they ﬁnd a plant sickly, proceed by c
causing it to have good and healthy, that is, “true” perceptions, instead
of bad ones. Similarly, the wise and efﬁcient politician is the man who
makes wholesome things seem just to a city instead of pernicious ones.
Whatever in any city is regarded as just and admirable isjust and admirable,
in that city and for so long as that convention maintains itself; but the
wise man replaces each pernicious convention by a wholesome one, making
this both be and seem just. Similarly the professional teacher who is able
to educate his pupils on these lines is a wise man, and is worth his large d
fees to them.
‘In this way we are enabled to hold both that some men are wiser than
others, and also that no man judges what is false. And you, too, whether
you like it or not, must put up with being a “measure.” For this is the line
we must take if we are to save the theory.
‘If you feel prepared to go back to the beginning, and make a case against
this theory, let us hear your objections set out in a connected argument.
Or, if you prefer the method of question and answer, do it that way; there
is no reason to try to evade that method either, indeed an intelligent person
might well prefer it to any other. Only I beg that you will observe this
condition: do not be unjust in your questions. It is the height of unreason- e
ableness that a person who professes to care for moral goodness should
be consistently unjust in discussion. I mean by injustice, in this connection,
the behavior of a man who does not take care to keep controversy distinct
from discussion; a man who forgets that in controversy he may play about
and trip up his opponent as often as he can, but that in discussion he must
be serious, he must keep on helping his opponent to his feet again, and
point out to him only those of his slips which are due to himself or to the 168
intellectual society which he has previously frequented. If you observe
this distinction, those who associate with you will blame themselves for
their confusion and their difﬁculties, not you. They will seek your company,
and think of you as their friend; but they will loathe themselves, and seek
refuge from themselves in philosophy, in the hope that they may thereby
become different people and be rid forever of the men that they once were.
But if you follow the common practice and do the opposite, you willTheaetetus 187
get the opposite results. Instead of philosophers, you will make your b
companions grow up to be the enemies of philosophy.
‘So, if you take my advice, as I said before, you will sit down with us
without ill will or hostility, in a kindly spirit. You will genuinely try to
ﬁnd out what our meaning is when we maintain (a) that all things are in
motion and (b) that for each person and each city, things are what they seem
to them to be. And upon this basis you will inquire whether knowledge and
perception are the same thing or different things. But you will not proceed
as you did just now. You will not base your argument upon the use and
wont of language; you will not follow the practice of most men, who drag c
words this way and that at their pleasure, so making every imaginable
difﬁculty for one another.’
Well, Theodorus, here is my contribution to the rescue of your friend —
the best I can do, with my resources, and little enough that is. If he were
alive himself, he would have come to the rescue of his offspring in a
grander style.
THEODORUS : That must be a joke, Socrates. It was a very spirited rescue.
SOCRATES : You are kind, my friend. Tell me now, did you notice that
Protagoras was complaining of us, in the speech that we have just heard, d
for addressing our arguments to a small boy and making the child’s ner-
vousness a weapon against his ideas? And how he disparaged our method
of arguments as merely an amusing game, and how solemnly he upheld
his‘measure of all things’ and commanded us to be serious when we dealt
with his theory?
THEODORUS : Yes, of course I noticed that, Socrates.
SOCRATES : Then do you think we should obey his commands?
THEODORUS : Most certainly I do.
SOCRATES : Look at the company then. They are all children but you. So
if we are to obey Protagoras, it is you and I who have got to be serious e
about his theory. It is you and I who must question and answer one
another. Then he will not have thisagainst us, at any rate, that we turned
the criticism of his philosophy into sport with boys.
THEODORUS : Well, isn’t our Theaetetus better able to follow the investiga-
tion of a theory than many an old fellow with a long beard?
SOCRATES : But not better than you, Theodorus. Do not go on imagining
that it is my business to be straining every nerve to defend your dead 169
friend while you do nothing. Come now, my very good Theodorus, come
a little way with me. Come with me at any rate until we see whether in
questions of geometrical proofs it is really you who should be the measure
or whether all men are as sufﬁcient to themselves as you are in astronomy
and all the other sciences in which you have made your name.
THEODORUS : Socrates, it is not easy for a man who has sat down beside
you to refuse to talk. That was all nonsense just now when I was pretending
that you were going to allow me to keep my coat on, and not use compul-
sion like the Spartans. So far from that, you seem to me to have leanings188 Theaetetus
towards the methods of Sciron.17The Spartans tell one either to strip or b
to go away; but you seem rather to be playing the part of Antaeus.18You
don’t let any comer go till you have stripped him and made him wrestle
with you in an argument.
SOCRATES : That, Theodorus, is an excellent simile to describe what is the
matter with me. But I am more of a ﬁend for exercise than Sciron and
Antaeus. I have met with many and many a Heracles and Theseus in my
time, mighty men of words; and they have well battered me. But for all
that I don’t retire from the ﬁeld, so terrible a lust has come upon me for c
these exercises. You must not grudge me this, either; try a fall with me
and we shall both be the better.
THEODORUS : All right. I resign myself; take me with you where you like.
In any case, I see, I have got to put up with the fate you spin for me, and
submit to your inquisition. But not further than the limits you have laid
down; beyond that I shall not be able to offer myself.
SOCRATES : It will do if you will go with me so far. Now there is one kind
of mistake I want you to be specially on your guard against, namely, that
we do not unconsciously slip into some childish form of argument. We d
don’t want to get into disgrace for this again.
THEODORUS : I will do my best, I promise you.
SOCRATES : The ﬁrst thing, then, is to tackle the same point that we were
dealing with before. We were making a complaint. Now let us see whether
we were right or wrong in holding it to be a defect in this theory that it
made every man self-sufﬁcient in wisdom; and whether we were right or
wrong when we made Protagoras concede that some men are superior
to others in questions of better and worse, these being ‘the wise’.D o
you agree?
THEODORUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : It would be a different matter if Protagoras were here in person
and agreed with us, instead of our having made this concession on his e
behalf in our attempt to help him. In that case, there would be no need
to take this question up again and make sure about it. In the circumstances,
however, it might be decided that we had no authority on his behalf, and
so it is desirable that we should come to a clearer agreement on this point;
for it makes no small difference whether this is so or not.
THEODORUS : True.
SOCRATES : Then don’t let us obtain this concession through anybody else. 170
Let us take the shortest way, an appeal to his own statement.
THEODORUS : How?
17. A legendary highwayman who attacked travellers on the coast between Megara and
Corinth. His most famous ‘method’ was to compel them to wash his feet, and kick them
over the cliff into the sea while they were so doing.
18. Antaeus was said to have lived in a cave and compelled all passers-by to wrestle
with him, with results invariably fatal to them.Theaetetus 189
SOCRATES : In this way. He says, does he not, that things are for every
man what they seem to him to be?
THEODORUS : Yes, that is what he says.
SOCRATES : Well, then, Protagoras, we too are expressing the judgments
of a man —I might say, of all men —when we say that there is no one in
the world who doesn’t believe that in some matters he is wiser than other
men; while in other matters, they are wiser than he. In emergencies —if at
no other time —you see this belief. When they are in distress, on the
battleﬁeld, or in sickness or in a storm at sea, all men turn to their leaders
in each sphere as to gods and look to them for salvation because they are b
superior in precisely this one thing —knowledge. And wherever human
life and work goes on, you ﬁnd everywhere men seeking teachers and
masters, for themselves and for other living creatures and for the direction
of all human works. You ﬁnd also men who believe that they are able to
teach and to take the lead. In all these cases, what else can we say but
that men do believe in the existence of both wisdom and ignorance
among themselves?
THEODORUS : There can be no other conclusion.
SOCRATES : And they believe that wisdom is true thinking? While igno-
rance is a matter of false judgment?
THEODORUS : Yes, of course. c
SOCRATES : What then, Protagoras, are we to make of your argument?
Are we to say that all men, on every occasion, judge what is true? Or that
they judge sometimes truly and sometimes falsely? Whichever we say, it
comes to the same thing, namely, that men do not always judge what is
true; that human judgments are both true and false. For think, Theodorus.
Would you, would anyone of the school of Protagoras be prepared to
contend that no one ever thinks his neighbor is ignorant or judging falsely?
THEODORUS : No, that’s not a thing one could believe, Socrates.
SOCRATES : And yet it is to this that our theory has been driven —this d
theory that man is the measure of all things.
THEODORUS : How is that?
SOCRATES : Well, suppose you come to a decision in your own mind and
then express a judgment about something to me. Let us assume with
Protagoras that your judgment is true for you. But isn’t it possible that the
rest of us may criticize your verdict? Do we always agree that your judg-
ment is true? Or does there rise up against you, every time, a vast army
of persons who think the opposite, who hold that your decisions and your
thoughts are false?
THEODORUS : Heaven knows they do, Socrates, in their ‘thousands and e
tens of thousands’, as Homer says,19and give me all the trouble that is
humanly possible.
19.Odyssey xvi.121.190 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : Then do you want us to say that you are then judging what
is true for yourself, but false for the tens of thousands?
THEODORUS : It looks as if that is what we must say, according to the
theory, at any rate.
SOCRATES : And what of Protagoras himself? Must he not say this, that
supposing he himself did not believe that man is the measure, any more
than the majority of people (who indeed do not believe it), then this Truth
which he wrote is true for no one? On the other hand, suppose he believed 171
it himself, but the majority of men do not agree with him; then you see —
to begin with —the more those to whom it does not seem to be the truth
outnumber those to whom it does, so much the more it isn’t than it is?
THEODORUS : That must be so, if it is going to be or not be according to
the individual judgment.
SOCRATES : Secondly, it has this most exquisite feature: Protagoras admits,
I presume, that the contrary opinion about his own opinion (namely, that
it is false) must be true, seeing he agrees that all men judge what is.
THEODORUS : Undoubtedly.
SOCRATES : And in conceding the truth of the opinion of those who think b
him wrong, he is really admitting the falsity of his own opinion?
THEODORUS : Yes, inevitably.
SOCRATES : But for their part the others do not admit that they are wrong?
THEODORUS : No.
SOCRATES : But Protagoras again admits thisjudgment to be true, accord-
ing to his written doctrine?
THEODORUS : So it appears.
SOCRATES : It will be disputed, then, by everyone, beginning with Protag-
oras —or rather, it will be admitted by him, when he grants to the person
who contradicts him that he judges truly —when he does that, even Protag- c
oras himself will be granting that neither a dog nor the ‘man in the street’
is the measure of anything at all which he has not learned. Isn’t that so?
THEODORUS :I ti ss o .
SOCRATES : Then since it is disputed by everyone, the Truth of Protagoras
is not true for anyone at all, not even for himself?
THEODORUS : Socrates, we are running my friend too hard.
SOCRATES : But it is not at all clear, my dear Theodorus, that we are
running off the right track. Hence it is likely that Protagoras, being older
than we are, really is wiser as well; and if he were to stick up his head d
from below as far as the neck just here where we are, he would in all
likelihood convict me twenty times over of talking nonsense, and show
you up too for agreeing with me, before he ducked down to rush off again.
But we have got to take ourselves as we are, I suppose, and go on saying
the things which seem to us to be. At the moment, then, mustn’tw e
maintain that any man would admit at least this, that some men are wiser
than their fellows and others more ignorant?
THEODORUS : So it seems to me, at any rate.Theaetetus 191
SOCRATES : We may also suggest that the theory would stand ﬁrm most
successfully in the position which we sketched out for it in our attempt e
to bring help to Protagoras. I mean the position that most things are for
the individual what they seem to him to be; for instance, warm, dry, sweet
and all this type of thing. But if the theory is going to admit that there is
any sphere in which one man is superior to another, it might perhaps be
prepared to grant it in questions of what is good or bad for one’s health.
Here it might well be admitted that it is not true that every creature—
woman or child or even animal—is competent to recognize what is good
for it and to heal its own sickness; that here, if anywhere, one person is
better than another. Do you agree?
THEODORUS : Yes, that seems so to me.
SOCRATES : Then consider political questions. Some of these are questions 172
of what may or may not ﬁttingly be done, of just and unjust, of pious and
impious; and here the theory may be prepared to maintain that whatever
view a city takes on these matters and establishes as its law or convention,
is truth and fact for that city. In such matters neither any individual nor
any city can claim superior wisdom. But when it is a question of laying
down what is to the interest of the state and what is not, the matter is
different. The theory will again admit that here, if anywhere, one counsellor
is better than another; here the decision of one city may be more in confor-
mity with the truth than that of another. It would certainly not have the b
hardihood to afﬁrm that when a city decides that a certain thing is to its
own interest, that thing will undoubtedly turn out to be to its interest. It
is in those other questions I am talking about—just and unjust, pious and
impious—that men are ready to insist that no one of these things has by
nature any being of its own; in respect of these, they say, what seems to
people collectively to be so is true, at the time when it seems that way
and for just as long as it so seems. And even those who are not prepared
to go all the way with Protagoras take some such view of wisdom. But I
see, Theodorus, that we are becoming involved in a greater discussion c
emerging from the lesser one.
THEODORUS : Well, we have plenty of time, haven’t we, Socrates?
SOCRATES : We appear to . . . That remark of yours, my friend, reminds
me of an idea that has often occurred to me before—how natural it is that
men who have spent a great part of their lives in philosophical studies make
such fools of themselves when they appear as speakers in the law courts.
THEODORUS : How do you mean now?
SOCRATES : Well, look at the man who has been knocking about in law
courts and such places ever since he was a boy; and compare him with
the man brought up in philosophy, in the life of a student. It is surely like d
comparing the upbringing of a slave with that of a free man.
THEODORUS : How is that, now?
SOCRATES : Because the one man always has what you mentioned just
now—plenty of time. When he talks, he talks in peace and quiet, and his192 Theaetetus
time is his own. It is so with us now: here we are beginning on our third
new discussion; and he can do the same, if he is like us, and prefers the
newcomer to the question in hand. It does not matter to such men whether
they talk for a day or a year, if only they may hit upon that which is. But
the other —the man of the law courts —is always in a hurry when he is e
talking; he has to speak with one eye on the clock. Besides, he can’t make
his speeches on any subject he likes; he has his adversary standing over
him, armed with compulsory powers and with the sworn statement, which
is read out point by point as he proceeds, and must be kept to by the
speaker. The talk is always about a fellow-slave, and is addressed to a
master, who sits there holding some suit or other in his hand. And the
struggle is never a matter of indifference; it always directly concerns the
speaker, and sometimes life itself is at stake.
Such conditions make him keen and highly strung, skilled in ﬂattering 173
the master and working his way into favor; but cause his soul to be small
and warped. His early servitude prevents him from making a free, straight
growth; it forces him into doing crooked things by imposing dangers and
alarms upon a soul that is still tender. He cannot meet these by just and
honest practice, and so resorts to lies and to the policy of repaying one
wrong with another; thus he is constantly being bent and distorted, and b
in the end grows up to manhood with a mind that has no health in it,
having now become —in his own eyes —a man of ability and wisdom.
There is your practical man, Theodorus. What about our own set? Would
you like us to have a review of them, or shall we let them be, and return
to the argument? We don’t want to abuse this freedom to change our
subject of which we were speaking just now.
THEODORUS : No, no, Socrates. Let us review the philosophers. What you c
said just now was quite right; we who move in such circles are not the
servants but the masters of our discussions. Our arguments are our own,
like slaves; each one must wait about for us, to be ﬁnished whenever we
think ﬁt. We have no jury, and no audience (as the dramatic poets have),
sitting in control over us, ready to criticize and give orders.
SOCRATES : Very well, then; we must review them, it seems, since you
have made up your mind. But let us conﬁne ourselves to the leaders;
why bother about the second-rate specimens? To begin with, then, the
philosopher grows up without knowing the way to the market-place, or d
the whereabouts of the law courts or the council chambers or any other
place of public assembly. Laws and decrees, published orally or in writing,
are things he never sees or hears. The scrambling of political cliques for
ofﬁce; social functions, dinners, parties with ﬂute-girls —such doings never
enter his head even in a dream. So with questions of birth —he has no
more idea whether a fellow citizen is high-born or humble, or whether he
has inherited some taint from his forebears, male or female, than he has
of the number of pints in the sea, as they say. And in all these matters, e
he knows not even that he knows not; for he does not hold himself aloof
from them in order to get a reputation, but because it is in reality only hisTheaetetus 193
body that lives and sleeps in the city. His mind, having come to the
conclusion that all these things are of little or no account, spurns them
and pursues its winge ´d way, as Pindar says,20throughout the universe,
‘in the deeps beneath the earth’ and geometrizing its surfaces, ‘in the
heights above the heaven’, astronomizing, and tracking down by every
path the entire nature of each whole among the things that are, never 174
condescending to what lies near at hand.
THEODORUS : What do you mean by that, Socrates?
SOCRATES : Well, here’s an instance: they say Thales21was studying the
stars, Theodorus, and gazing aloft, when he fell into a well; and a witty
and amusing Thracian servant-girl made fun of him because, she said, he
was wild to know about what was up in the sky but failed to see what
was in front of him and under his feet. The same joke applies to all who
spend their lives in philosophy. It really is true that the philosopher fails b
to see his next-door neighbor; he not only doesn’t notice what he is doing;
he scarcely knows whether he is a man or some other kind of creature.
The question he asks is, What is Man? What actions and passions properly
belong to human nature and distinguish it from all other beings? This is
what he wants to know and concerns himself to investigate. You see what
I mean, Theodorus, don’t you?
THEODORUS : Yes, and what you say is true.
SOCRATES : This accounts, my friend, for the behavior of such a man when
he comes into contact with his fellows, either privately with individuals c
or in public life, as I was saying at the beginning. Whenever he is obliged,
in a law court or elsewhere, to discuss the things that lie at his feet and
before his eyes, he causes entertainment not only to Thracian servant-girls
but to all the common herd, by tumbling into wells and every sort of
difﬁculty through his lack of experience. His clumsiness is awful and gets
him a reputation for fatuousness. On occasions when personal scandal is
the topic of conversation, he never has anything at all of his own to
contribute; he knows nothing to the detriment of anyone, never having
paid any attention to this subject—a lack of resource which makes him d
look very comic. And again, when compliments are in order, and self-
laudation, his evident amusement—which is by no means a pose but
perfectly genuine—is regarded as idiotic. When he hears the praises of a
despot or a king being sung, it sounds to his ears as if some stock-breeder
were being congratulated—some keeper of pigs or sheep, or cows that are
giving him plenty of milk; only he thinks that the rulers have a more
difﬁcult and treacherous animal to rear and milk, and that such a man,
having no spare time, is bound to become quite as coarse and uncultivated e
as the stock-farmer; for the castle of the one is as much a prison as the
20. This quotation from a lost poem of Pindar’s is listed as his frag. 292 (Snell).
21. The ﬁrst founder of Greek natural philosophy (sixth century B.C.), about whom we
have anecdotes but little solid information.194 Theaetetus
mountain fold of the other. When he hears talk of land —that so-and-so
has a property of ten thousand acres or more, and what a vast property
that is, it sounds to him like a tiny plot, used as he is to envisage the
whole earth. When his companions become lyric on the subject of great
families, and exclaim at the noble blood of one who can point to seven
wealthy ancestors, he thinks that such praise comes of a dim and limited
vision, an inability, through lack of education, to take a steady view of 175
the whole, and to calculate that every single man has countless hosts of
ancestors, near and remote, among whom are to be found, in every instance,
rich men and beggars, kings and slaves, Greeks and foreigners, by the
thousand. When men pride themselves upon a pedigree of twenty- ﬁve
ancestors, and trace their descent back to Heracles the son of Amphitryon,
they seem to him to be taking a curious interest in tri ﬂes. As for the twenty- b
ﬁfth ancestor of Amphitryon, what hemay have been is merely a matter
of luck, and similarly with the ﬁftieth before him again. How ridiculous,
he thinks, not to be able to work that out, and get rid of the gaping vanity
of a silly mind.
On all these occasions, you see, the philosopher is the object of general
derision, partly for what men take to be his superior manner, and partly
for his constant ignorance and lack of resource in dealing with the obvious.
THEODORUS : What you say exactly describes what does happen, Socrates.
SOCRATES : But consider what happens, my friend, when he in his turn
draws someone to a higher level, and induces him to abandon questions
of‘My injustice towards you, or yours towards me’ for an examination of c
justice and injustice themselves —what they are, and how they differ from
everything else and from each other; or again, when he gets him to leave
such questions as ‘Whether a king who possesses much gold is happy? ’22
for an inquiry into kingship, and into human happiness and misery in
general —what these two things are, and what, for a human being, is the
proper method by which the one can be obtained and the other avoided.
When it is an account of matters like all these that is demanded of our d
friend with the small, sharp, legal mind, the situation is reversed; his head
swims as, suspended at such a height, he gazes down from his place among
the clouds; disconcerted by the unusual experience, he knows not what
to do next, and can only stammer when he speaks. And that causes great
entertainment, not to Thracian servant-girls or any other uneducated per-
sons —they do not see what is going on —but to all men who have not
been brought up like slaves.
These are the two types, Theodorus. There is the one who has been e
brought up in true freedom and leisure, the man you call a philosopher;
a man to whom it is no disgrace to appear simple and good-for-nothing
when he is confronted with menial tasks, when, for instance, he doesn ’t
know how to make a bed, or how to sweeten a sauce or a ﬂattering speech.
Then you have the other, the man who is keen and smart at doing all
22. Reading, with Madvig, tau¨chrusion.Theaetetus 195
these jobs, but does not know how to strike up a song in his turn like a
free man, or how to tune the strings of common speech to the ﬁtting praise 176
of the life of gods and of the happy among men.
THEODORUS : Socrates, if your words convinced everyone as they do me,
there would be more peace and less evil on earth.
SOCRATES : But it is not possible, Theodorus, that evil should be de-
stroyed —for there must always be something opposed to the good; nor
is it possible that it should have its seat in heaven. But it must inevitably
haunt human life, and prowl about this earth. That is why a man should
make all haste to escape from earth to heaven; and escape means becoming b
as like God as possible; and a man becomes like God when he becomes
just and pious, with understanding. But it is not at all an easy matter, my
good friend, to persuade men that it is not for the reasons commonly
alleged that one should try to escape from wickedness and pursue virtue.
It is not in order to avoid a bad reputation and obtain a good one that
virtue should be practiced and not vice; that, it seems to me, is only what c
men call ‘old wives’ talk’.
Let us try to put the truth in this way. In God there is no sort of wrong
whatsoever; he is supremely just, and the thing most like him is the man
who has become as just as it lies in human nature to be. And it is here
that we see whether a man is truly able, or truly a weakling and a nonentity;
for it is the realization of this that is genuine wisdom and goodness, while
the failure to realize it is manifest folly and wickedness. Everything else
that passes for ability and wisdom has a sort of commonness —in those
who wield political power a poor cheap show, in the manual workers a
matter of mechanical routine. If, therefore, one meets a man who practices d
injustice and is blasphemous in his talk or in his life, the best thing for
him by far is that one should never grant that there is any sort of ability
about his unscrupulousness; such men are ready enough to glory in the
reproach, and think that it means not that they are mere rubbish, cumbering
the ground to no purpose, but that they have the kind of qualities that
are necessary for survival in the community. We must therefore tell them
the truth —that their very ignorance of their true state ﬁxes them the more
ﬁrmly therein. For they do not know what is the penalty of injustice, which
is the last thing of which a man should be ignorant. It is not what they
suppose —scourging and death —things which they may entirely evade in
spite of their wrongdoing. It is a penalty from which there is no escape. e
THEODORUS : And what is that?
SOCRATES : My friend, there are two patterns set up in reality. One is
divine and supremely happy; the other has nothing of God in it, and is
the pattern of the deepest unhappiness. This truth the evildoer does not
see; blinded by folly and utter lack of understanding, he fails to perceive 177
that the effect of his unjust practices is to make him grow more and more
like the one, and less and less like the other. For this he pays the penalty
of living the life that corresponds to the pattern he is coming to resemble.
And if we tell him that, unless he is delivered from this ‘ability’ of his,196 Theaetetus
when he dies the place that is pure of all evil will not receive him; that
he will forever go on living in this world a life after his own likeness —a
bad man tied to bad company: he will but think, ‘This is the way fools
talk to a clever rascal like me.’
THEODORUS : Oh, yes, Socrates, sure enough.
SOCRATES : I know it, my friend. But there is one accident to which the b
unjust man is liable. When it comes to giving and taking an account in a
private discussion of the things he disparages; when he is willing to stand
his ground like a man for long enough, instead of running away like a
coward, then, my friend, an odd thing happens. In the end the things he
says do not satisfy even himself; that famous eloquence of his somehow
dries up, and he is left looking nothing more than a child.
But we had better leave it there; all this is really a digression; and if we c
go on, a ﬂood of new subjects will pour in and overwhelm our original
argument. So, if you don’t mind, we will go back to what we were say-
ing before.
THEODORUS : As a matter of fact, Socrates, Ilike listening to this kind of
talk; it is easier for a man of my years to follow. Still, if you like, let us
go back to the argument.
SOCRATES : Well, then, we were at somewhere about this point in the
argument, weren’t we? We were speaking of the people who assert a being
that is in motion, and who hold that for every individual things always
are whatever they seem to him to be; and we said that they were prepared
to stand upon their principle in almost every case —not least in questions
of what is just and right. Here they are perfectly ready to maintain that
whatever any community decides to be just and right, and establishes as d
such, actually is what is just and right for that community and for as long
as it remains so established. On the other hand, when it is a question of
what things are good, we no longer ﬁnd anyone so heroic that he will
venture to contend that whatever a community thinks useful, and estab-
lishes, really is useful, so long as it is the established order —unless, of
course, he means that it is called ‘useful’; but that would be making a game
of our argument, wouldn’t it?
THEODORUS : It would indeed.
SOCRATES : Let us suppose, then, that he is not talking about the name e
‘useful’ but has in view the thing to which it is applied.
THEODORUS : Agreed.
SOCRATES : It is surely this that a government aims at when it legislates,
whatever name it calls it. A community always makes such laws as are
most useful to it —so far as the limits of its judgment and capacity permit. —
Or do you think legislation may have some other object in view?
THEODORUS : Oh no, not at all. 178
SOCRATES : And does a community always achieve this object? Or are
there always a number of failures?
THEODORUS : It seems to me that there are failures.Theaetetus 197
SOCRATES : Now we might put this matter in a rather different way
and be still more likely to get people generally to agree with our
conclusions. I mean, one might put a question about the whole class
of things to which ‘what is useful’ belongs. These things are concerned,
I take it, with future time; thus when we legislate, we make laws that
are going to be useful in the time to come. This kind of thing we may
properly call ‘future’.
THEODORUS : Yes, certainly. b
SOCRATES : Come then, let’s put a question to Protagoras (or to anyone
who professes the same views): ‘Now, Protagoras, “Man is the measure
of all things” as you people say —of white and heavy and light and all
that kind of thing without exception. He has the criterion of these things
within himself; so when he thinks that they are as he experiences them,
he thinks what is true and what really is for him.’ Isn’t that so?
THEODORUS :I ti s .
SOCRATES :‘Then, Protagoras,’ we shall say, ‘what about things that are
going to be in the future? Has a man the criterion of these within himself? c
When he thinks certain things will be, do they actually happen, for him,
as he thought they would? Take heat, for example. Suppose the ordinary
man thinks he is going to take a fever, and that his temperature will go
up to fever point; while another man, this time a doctor, thinks the opposite.
Do we hold that the future will conﬁrm either the one judgment or the
other? Or are we to say that it will conﬁrm both; that is, that for the doctor
the man will not have a temperature or be suffering from fever, while for
himself he will?’
THEODORUS : That would be absurd.
SOCRATES : But, when there is a question of the sweetness and dryness
of the next vintage, I presume it would always be the grower ’s judgment d
that would carry authority, rather than that of a musician?
THEODORUS : Of course.
SOCRATES : Nor again, in any question of what will be in tune or out of
tune, would the judgment of a teacher of gymnastic be superior to that of
a musician —even about what is going to seem to be in tune to the gymnastic
master himself?
THEODORUS : No, never.
SOCRATES : Or suppose a dinner is being prepared. Even the guest who
is going to eat it, if he has no knowledge of cooking, will not be able to
pronounce so authoritative a verdict as the professional cook on how nice
it is going to be. I say ‘going to be’, because we had better not at this stage e
press our point as regards what is now pleasant to any individual, or what
has been in the past. Our question for the moment is, whether the individual
himself is the best judge, for himself, of what is going to seem and be for
him in the future. ‘Or,’ we will ask, ‘would not you, Protagoras, predict
better than any layman about the persuasive effect that speeches in a law
court will have upon any one of us?’198 Theaetetus
THEODORUS : And in fact, Socrates, this at any rate is a point on which
Protagoras used to make strong claims to superiority over other people.
SOCRATES : Of course he did, my dear good fellow. No one would have
paid large fees for the privilege of talking with him if he had not been in 179
the habit of persuading his pupils that he was a better judge than any
fortune-teller—or anyone else—about what was going to be and seem to
be in the future.23
THEODORUS : That’s true enough.
SOCRATES : Legislation also and ‘what is useful’ is concerned with the
future; and it would be generally admitted to be inevitable that a city
when it legislates often fails to achieve what is the most useful.
THEODORUS : Yes, surely.
SOCRATES : Then we shall be giving your master fair measure if we tell
him that he has now got to admit that one man is wiser than another, and b
that it is such a man who is ‘the measure’; but that I, the man with no
special knowledge, have not by any means got to be a measure—a part
which the recent speech in his defense was trying to force upon me, whether
I liked it or not.
THEODORUS : Now that, Socrates, seems to me to be the chief point on
which the theory is convicted of error—though it stands convicted also
when it makes other men’s judgments carry authority and these turn out
to involve thinking that Protagoras’ statements are completely untrue.
SOCRATES : There is more than one point besides these, Theodorus, on c
which a conviction might be secured—at least so far as it is a matter of
proving that not every man’s judgment is true. But so long as we keep
within the limits of that immediate present experience of the individual
which gives rise to perceptions and to perceptual judgments, it is more
difﬁcult to convict these latter of being untrue—but perhaps I’m talking
nonsense. Perhaps it is not possible to convict them at all; perhaps those
who profess that they are perfectly evident and are always knowledge
may be saying what really is. And it may be that our Theaetetus was not
far from the mark with his proposition that knowledge and perception d
are the same thing. We shall have to come to closer grips with the theory,
as the speech on behalf of Protagoras required us to do. We shall have to
consider and test this moving Being, and ﬁnd whether it rings true or
sounds as if it had some ﬂaw in it. There is no small ﬁght going on about
it, anyway—and no shortage of ﬁghting men.
THEODORUS : No, indeed; but in Ionia it seems to be even growing, and
assuming vast dimensions. On the side of this theory, the Heraclitean party
is conducting a most vigorous campaign.
23. An alternative text (accepting the conjecture of de¯forme¯at 179a1 and retaining the
mss’ hauto ¯iat a3) yields: ‘if he really was in the habit of persuading his pupils that, even
about the future, neither a fortune-teller nor anyone else can judge better than one can
for oneself’.Theaetetus 199
SOCRATES : The more reason, then, my dear Theodorus, why we should
examine it by going back to its ﬁrst principle,24which is the way they e
present it themselves.
THEODORUS : I quite agree. You know, Socrates, these Heraclitean doc-
trines (or, as you say, Homeric or still more ancient) —you can’t discuss
them in person with any of the people at Ephesus who profess to be adepts,
any more than you could with a maniac. They are just like the things they
say in their books —always on the move. As for abiding by what is said,
or sticking to a question, or quietly answering and asking questions in turn, 180
there is less than nothing of that in their capacity. That ’s an exaggeration, no
doubt. I mean there isn’t so much as a tiny bit of repose in these people.
If you ask any one of them a question, he will pull out some little enigmatic
phrase from his quiver and shoot it off at you; and if you try to make him
give an account of what he has said, you will only get hit by another, full
of strange turns of language. You will never reach any conclusion with
any of them, ever; indeed they never reach any conclusion with each other,
they are so very careful not to allow anything to be stable, either in an b
argument or in their own souls. I suppose they think that if they did it
would be something that stands still —this being what they are totally at
war with, and what they are determined to banish from the universe, if
they can.
SOCRATES : I dare say, Theodorus, you have seen these men only on the
ﬁeld of battle, and never been with them in times of peace —as you don’t
belong to their set. I expect they keep such matters to be explained at
leisure to their pupils whom they want to make like themselves.
THEODORUS :Pupils, my good man? There are no pupils and teachers
among these people. They just spring up on their own, one here, one there, c
wherever they happen to catch their inspiration; and no one of them will
credit another with knowing anything. As I was just going to say, you
will never get these men to give an account of themselves, willingly or
unwillingly. What we must do is to take their doctrine out of their hands
and consider it for ourselves, as we should a problem in geometry.
SOCRATES : What you say is very reasonable. This problem now, we have
inherited it, have we not, from the ancients? They used poetical forms d
which concealed from the majority of men their real meaning, namely,
that Ocean and Tethys, the origin of all things, are actually ﬂowing streams,
and nothing stands still. In more modern times, the problem is presented
to us by men who, being more accomplished in these matters, plainly
demonstrate their meaning so that even shoemakers may hear and assimi-
late their wisdom, and give up the silly idea that some things in this world
stand still while others move, learn that all things are in motion, and
recognize the greatness of their instructors.
24. I.e., the principle that everything is really motion (156a).200 Theaetetus
But I was almost forgetting, Theodorus, that there are other thinkers
who have announced the opposite view; who tell us that ’Unmoved is the e
Universe’,25and other similar statements which we hear from a Melissus26
or a Parmenides as against the whole party of Heracliteans. These philoso-
phers insist that all things are One, and that this One stands still, itself
within itself, having no place in which to move.
What are we to do with all these people, my friend? We have been
gradually advancing till, without realizing it, we have got ourselves in
between the two parties; and if we don ’t in some way manage to put up 181
aﬁght and make our escape, we shall pay for it, like the people who play
that game on the line in the wrestling schools, and get caught by both
parties and pulled in opposite directions.
Now I think we ought to begin by examining the other party, the ﬂuent
fellows we started to pursue. If they appear to us to be talking sense, we
will help them to drag us over to their side, and try to escape the others.
But if those who make their stand for the whole appear to be nearer the
truth, we will take refuge with them from the men who ‘move what should b
not be moved’. And if it appears that neither party has a reasonable theory,
then we shall be very absurd if we think that insigni ﬁcant people like
ourselves can have anything to say, after we have rejected the views of men
who lived so long ago and possessed all wisdom. Think now, Theodorus, is
it of any use for us to go forward upon such a dangerous venture?
THEODORUS : We can’t refuse to examine the doctrines of these two schools,
Socrates; that couldn’t be allowed.
SOCRATES : Then we must examine them, if youfeel so strongly about it. c
Now it seems to me that the proper starting point of our criticism is the
nature of motion; what is this thing that they are talking about when they
say that all things are in motion? I mean, for example, are they referring
to one form of motion only, or, as I think, to two —but don’t let this be
only what Ithink. You commit yourself as well, so that we may come to
grief together, if need be. Tell me, do you call it ‘motion’ when a thing
changes from one place to another or turns round in the same place?
THEODORUS : I do, yes.
SOCRATES : Here then is one form of motion. Then supposing a thing
remains in the same place, but grows old, or becomes black instead of d
white, or hard instead of soft, or undergoes any other alteration; isn ’ti t
right to say that here we have motion in another form?
THEODORUS : Unquestionably.
SOCRATES : Then I now have two forms of motion, alteration and spa-
tial movement.
THEODORUS : Yes; and that’s quite correct.
SOCRATES : Then now that we have made this distinction, let us have a
talk with the people who allege that all things are in motion. Let us ask
25. Both the text and the sense of this quotation are uncertain.
26. Melissus of Samos was a ﬁfth-century follower of Parmenides.Theaetetus 201
them, ‘Do you hold that everything is in motion in both ways, that is, that e
it both moves through space and undergoes alteration? Or do you suggest
that some things are in motion in both ways, and some only in one or
the other?’
THEODORUS : Heaven knows, Ican’t answer that. I suppose they would
say, in both ways.
SOCRATES : Yes; otherwise, my friend, it will turn out that, in their view,
things are both moving and standing still; and it will be no more correct
to say that all things are in motion than to say that all things stand still.
THEODORUS : That’s perfectly true.
SOCRATES : Then since they must be in motion, and there is no such thing
anywhere as absence of motion, it follows that all things are always in 182
every kind of motion.
THEODORUS : Yes, that must be so.
SOCRATES : Then I want you to consider this point in their theory. As we
were saying, they hold that the genesis of things such as warmth and
whiteness occurs when each of them is moving, together with a perception,
in the space between the active and passive factors: the passive factor
thereby becoming percipient, but not a perception, while the active factor
becomes such or such, but not a quality —isn’t that so? But perhaps ‘quality’
seems a strange word to you; perhaps you don ’t quite understand it as a
general expression.27So I will talk about particular cases. What I mean is
that the active factor becomes not warmth or whiteness, but warm and b
white; and so on. You will remember, perhaps, that we said in the earlier
stages of the argument that there is nothing which in itself is just one
thing; and that this applies also to the active and passive factors. It is by
the association of the two with one another that they generate perceptions
and the things perceived; and in so doing, the active factor becomes such
and such, while the passive factor becomes percipient.
THEODORUS : Yes, I remember that, of course.
SOCRATES : Then we need not concern ourselves about other points in c
their doctrine, whether they mean what we say or something else. We
must keep our eyes simply upon the object of our discussion. We must
ask them this question: ‘According to you, all things move and ﬂow; isn’t
that so?’
THEODORUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : And they have both the motions that we distinguished, that
is to say, they both move and alter?
THEODORUS : That must be so, if they are to be wholly and completely
in motion.
SOCRATES : Now if they were only moving through space and not altering,
we should presumably be able to say what the moving things ﬂow? Or
how do we express it?
27. This is the ﬁrst occurrence in Greek of the word poiote ¯s,‘quality’ or‘what-sort-ness’,
coined by Plato from the interrogative adjective poios, ‘of what sort? ’.202 Theaetetus
THEODORUS : That’s all right.
SOCRATES : But since not even this abides, that what ﬂows ﬂows white, d
but rather it is in process of change, so that there is ﬂux of this very thing
also, the whiteness, and it is passing over into another color, lest it be
convicted of standing still in this respect —since that is so, is it possible to
give any name to a color which will properly apply to it?
THEODORUS : I don’t see how one could, Socrates; nor yet surely to any-
thing else of that kind, if, being in ﬂux, it is always quietly slipping away
as you speak?
SOCRATES : And what about any particular kind of perception; for exam-
ple, seeing or hearing? Does it ever abide, and remain seeing or hearing? e
THEODORUS : It ought not to, certainly, if all things are in motion.
SOCRATES : Then we may not call anything seeing rather than not-seeing;
nor indeed may we call it any other perception rather than not —if it be
admitted that all things are in motion in every way?
THEODORUS : No, we may not.
SOCRATES : Yet Theaetetus and I said that knowledge was perception?
THEODORUS : You did.
SOCRATES : And so our answer to the question, ‘What is knowledge?’
gave something which is no more knowledge than not.
THEODORUS : It seems as if it did. 183
SOCRATES :Aﬁne way this turns out to be of making our answer right.
We were most anxious to prove that all things are in motion, in order to
make that answer come out correct; but what has really emerged is that,
if all things are in motion, every answer, on whatever subject, is equally
correct, both ‘it is thus’ and ‘it is not thus’—or if you like ‘becomes’,a s
we don’t want to use any expressions which will bring our friends to
a standstill.
THEODORUS : You are quite right.
SOCRATES : Well, yes, Theodorus, except that I said ‘thus’ and ‘not thus’. b
One must not use even the word ‘thus’; for this ‘thus’ would no longer
be in motion; nor yet ‘not thus’ for here again there is no motion. The
exponents of this theory need to establish some other language; as it is,
they have no words that are consistent with their hypothesis —unless it
would perhaps suit them best to use ‘not at all thus’ in a quite indeﬁ-
nite sense.
THEODORUS : That would at least be an idiom most appropriate to them.
SOCRATES : Then we are set free from your friend, Theodorus. We do not c
yet concede to him that every man is the measure of all things, if he be
not a man of understanding. And we are not going to grant that knowledge
is perception, not at any rate on the line of inquiry which supposes that
all things are in motion; we are not going to grant it unless Theaetetus
here has some other way of stating it.
THEODORUS : That’s very good hearing, Socrates, for when these matters
were concluded I was to be set free from my task of answering you,Theaetetus 203
according to our agreement, which speciﬁed the end of the discussion of
Protagoras’ theory.
THEAETETUS : Oh, no, indeed, Theodorus! Not till you and Socrates have d
done what you proposed just now, and dealt with the other side, the
people who say that the Universe stands still.
THEODORUS : What’s this, Theaetetus? You at your age teaching your elders
to be unjust and break their agreements? What you have got to do is to pre-
pare to render account to Socrates yourself for the rest of the discussion.
THEAETETUS : All right, if he likes. But I would rather have listened to a
discussion of these views.
THEODORUS : Well, challenging Socrates to an argument is like inviting
‘cavalry into the plain’. So ask your questions and you shall hear.
SOCRATES : But I don’t think, Theodorus, that I am going to be persuaded
by Theaetetus to do what he demands. e
THEODORUS : But what is it makes you unwilling?
SOCRATES : Shame. I am afraid our criticism might be a very cheap affair.
And if I feel like this before the many who have made the universe one
and unmoved, Melissus and the rest of them, I feel it still more in the face
of the One—Parmenides. Parmenides seems to me, in the words of Homer,
to be ‘reverend’ and ‘awful’.28I met him when I was very young and he
was a very old man; and he seemed to me to have a wholly noble depth.29184
So I am afraid we might not understand even what he says; still less should
we attain to his real thought. Above all, I am afraid that the very object
of our discussion, the nature of knowledge, might be left unexamined
amid the crowd of theories that will rush in upon us if we admit them;
especially as the theory we have now brought up is one which involves
unmanageably vast issues. To treat it as a sideshow would be insult and
injury; while if it is adequately discussed, it is likely to spread out until
it completely eclipses the problems of knowledge. We must not do either.
What we must do is to make use of our midwife’s art to deliver Theaetetus b
of the thoughts which he has conceived about the nature of knowledge.*
THEODORUS : Well, if that is what you think proper, it must be done.
SOCRATES : Now, Theaetetus, I want you to think about one point in what
has been said. Your answer was that knowledge is perception, wasn’t it?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Now supposing you were asked: ‘With what does a man see
white and black things, and with what does he hear high and low notes?’
You would reply, I imagine, ‘With his eyes and ears.’
THEAETETUS : I should, yes.
28.Iliad iii.172.
29. A reference probablyto the discussion between Socrates andParmenides in Parmenides.
*Alternatively, this sentence could be translated: ‘What we must do is to make use of
our midwife’s art to set Theaetetus free from the thoughts which he has conceived about
the nature of knowledge’.204 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : Now as a rule it is no sign of ill-breeding to be easy in the c
use of language and take no particular care in one ’s choice of words; it is
rather the opposite that gives a man away. But such exactness is sometimes
necessary; and it is necessary here, for example, to fasten upon something
in your answer that is not correct. Think now. Is it more correct to say
that the eyes are that with which we see, or that through which we see?
Do we hear with the ears or through the ears?
THEAETETUS : Well, I should think, Socrates, that it is ‘through which’ we
perceive in each case, rather than ‘with which.’
SOCRATES : Yes, my son. It would be a very strange thing, I must say, if d
there were a number of perceptions sitting inside us as if we were Wooden
Horses, and there were not some single form, soul or whatever one ought
to call it, to which all these converge —something with which, through those
things,30as if they were instruments, we perceive all that is perceptible.
THEAETETUS : That sounds to me better than the other way of putting it.
SOCRATES : Now the reason why I am being so precise with you is this.
I want to know if it is with one and the same part of ourselves that we
reach, through our eyes to white and black things, and through the other e
means to yet further things; and whether, if asked, you will be able to
refer all these to the body. But perhaps it would be better if you stated
the answers yourself, rather than that I should busy myself on your behalf.
Tell me: the instruments through which you perceive hot, hard, light, sweet
things —do you consider that they all belong to the body? Or can they be
referred elsewhere?
THEAETETUS : No, they all belong to the body.
SOCRATES : And are you also willing to admit that what you perceive
through one power, you can’t perceive through another? For instance, 185
what you perceive through hearing, you couldn’t perceive through sight,
and similarly what you perceive through sight you couldn ’t perceive
through hearing?
THEAETETUS : I could hardly refuse to grant that.
SOCRATES : Then suppose you think something about both; you can ’t
possibly be having a perception about both, either through one of these
instruments or through the other?
THEAETETUS : No.
SOCRATES : Now take a sound and a color. First of all, don ’t you think
this same thing about both of them, namely, that they both are?
THEAETETUS : I do.
SOCRATES : Also that each of them is different from the other and the
same as itself?
THEAETETUS : Of course. b
SOCRATES : And that both together are two, and each of them is one?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I think that too.
30. Viz., the eyes and ears.Theaetetus 205
SOCRATES : Are you also able to consider whether they are like or unlike
each other?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I may be.
SOCRATES : Now what is it through which you think all these things about
them? It is not possible, you see, to grasp what is common to both either
through sight or through hearing. Let us consider another thing which
will show the truth of what we are saying. Suppose it were possible to
inquire whether both are salty or not. You can tell me, of course, with c
what you would examine them. It would clearly be neither sight nor
hearing, but something else.
THEAETETUS : Yes, of course; the power which functions through the
tongue.
SOCRATES : Good. Now through what does that power function which
reveals to you what is common in the case both of all things and of these
two—I mean that which you express by the words ‘is’and ‘is not’ and
the other terms used in our questions about them just now? What kind
of instruments will you assign for all these? Through what does that which
is percipient in us perceive all of them?
THEAETETUS : You mean being and not-being, likeness and unlikeness,
same and different; also one, and any other number applied to them. And d
obviously too your question is about odd and even, and all that is involved
with these attributes; and you want to know through what bodily instru-
ments we perceive all these with the soul.
SOCRATES : You follow me exceedingly well, Theaetetus. These are just
the things I am asking about.
THEAETETUS : But Icouldn’t possibly say. All I can tell you is that it doesn ’t
seem to me that for these things there is any special instrument at all, as
there is for the others. It seems to me that in investigating the common e
features of everything the soul functions through itself.
SOCRATES : Yes, Theaetetus, you would say that, because you are hand-
some and not ugly as Theodorus would have it.31For handsome is as
handsome says. And besides being handsome, you have done me a good
turn; you have saved me a vast amount of talk if it seems to you that,
while the soul considers some things through the bodily powers, there are
others which it considers alone and through itself. This was what I thought
myself, but I wanted you to think it too.
THEAETETUS : Well, it does seem to me to be so. 186
SOCRATES : Now in which class do you put being? For that, above all, is
something that accompanies everything.
THEAETETUS : I should put it among the things which the soul itself reaches
out after by itself.
SOCRATES : Also like and unlike, same and different?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : What about beautiful and ugly, good and bad?
31. Cf. 143e.206 Theaetetus
THEAETETUS : Yes, these too; in these, above all, I think the soul examines
their being in comparison with one another. Here it seems to be making b
a calculation within itself of past and present in relation to future.
SOCRATES : Not so fast, now. Wouldn’t you say that it is through touch
that the soul perceives the hardness of what is hard, and similarly the
softness of what is soft?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But as regards their being —the fact that they are —their oppo-
sition to one another, and the being, again, of this opposition, the matter
is different. Here the soul itself attempts to reach a decision for us by
rising to compare them with one another.
THEAETETUS : Yes, undoubtedly.
SOCRATES : And thus there are some things which all creatures, men and c
animals alike, are naturally able to perceive as soon as they are born; I mean,
the experiences which reach the soul through the body. But calculations
regarding their being and their advantageousness come, when they do,
only as the result of a long and arduous development, involving a good
deal of trouble and education.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that certainly is so.
SOCRATES : Now is it possible for someone who does not even get at being
to get at truth?
THEAETETUS : No; it’s impossible.
SOCRATES : And if a man fails to get at the truth of a thing, will he ever
be a person who knows that thing?
THEAETETUS : I don’t see how, Socrates. d
SOCRATES : Then knowledge is to be found not in the experiences but in
the process of reasoning about them; it is here, seemingly, not in the
experiences, that it is possible to grasp being and truth.
THEAETETUS : So it appears.
SOCRATES : Then in the face of such differences, would you call both by
the same name?
THEAETETUS : One would certainly have no right to.
SOCRATES : Now what name do you give to the former —seeing, hearing,
smelling, feeling cold or warm?
THEAETETUS : I call that perceiving —what else could I call it? e
SOCRATES : So the whole lot taken together you call perception?
THEAETETUS : Necessarily.
SOCRATES : Which, we say, has no share in the grasping of truth, since it
has none in the grasping of being.
THEAETETUS : No, it has none.
SOCRATES : So it has no share in knowledge either.
THEAETETUS : No.
SOCRATES : Then, Theaetetus, perception and knowledge could never be
the same thing.
THEAETETUS : No, apparently not, Socrates; we have now got the clearest
possible proof that knowledge is something different from perception.Theaetetus 207
SOCRATES : But our object in beginning this discussion was not to ﬁnd 187
out what knowledge is not, but to ﬁnd out what it is. However, we have
made a little progress. We shall not now look for knowledge in sense-
perception at all, but in whatever we call that activity of the soul when it
is busy by itself about the things which are.
THEAETETUS : Well, the name, Socrates, I suppose is judgment.
SOCRATES : Your opinion, my dear lad, is correct. Now look back to the
beginning. Wipe out all that we have said hitherto, and see if you can see b
any better from where you have now progressed to. Tell me again, what
is knowledge?
THEAETETUS : Well, Socrates, one can’t say that it is judgment in general,
because there is also false judgment —but true judgment may well be
knowledge. So let that be my answer. If the same thing happens again, and
weﬁnd, as we go on, that it turns out not to be so, we’ll try something else.
SOCRATES : And even so, Theaetetus, you have answered me in the way
one ought —with a good will, and not reluctantly, as you did at ﬁrst. If c
we continue like this, one of two things will happen. Either we shall ﬁnd
what we are going out after; or we shall be less inclined to think we know
things which we don’t know at all —and even that would be a reward we
could not fairly be dissatisﬁed with. Now what is this that you say? There
are two forms of judgment, true and false; and your deﬁnition is that true
judgment is knowledge?
THEAETETUS : Yes. That is how it looks to me now.
SOCRATES : Now I wonder if it’s worth while, at this stage, to go back to
an old point about judgment —
THEAETETUS : What point do you mean?
SOCRATES : I have something on my mind which has often bothered me d
before, and got me into great difﬁculty, both in my own thought and in
discussion with other people —I mean, I can’t say what it is, this experience
we have, and how it arises in us.
THEAETETUS : What experience?
SOCRATES : Judging what is false. Even now, you know, I’m still consider-
ing; I’m in two minds whether to let it go or whether to look into it in a
different manner from a short while ago.
THEAETETUS : Why not, Socrates, if this appears for any reason to be the
right thing to do? As you and Theodorus were saying just now, and quite
rightly, when you were talking about leisure, we are not pressed for time
in talk of this kind.
SOCRATES : A very proper reminder. Perhaps it would not be a bad mo- e
ment to go back upon our tracks. It is better to accomplish a little well
than a great deal unsatisfactorily.
THEAETETUS : Yes, it certainly is.
SOCRATES : Now how are we to proceed? And actually what is it that we
are saying? We claim, don’t we, that false judgment repeatedly occurs and
one of us judges falsely, the other truly, as if it was in the nature of things
for this to happen?208 Theaetetus
THEAETETUS : That is what we claim.
SOCRATES : Now isn’t it true about all things, together or individually, 188
that we must either know them or not know them? I am ignoring for the
moment the intermediate conditions of learning and forgetting, as they
don’t affect the argument here.
THEAETETUS : Of course, Socrates, in that case there is no alternative. With
each thing we either know it or we do not.
SOCRATES : Then when a man judges, the objects of his judgment are
necessarily either things which he knows or things which he doesn’t know?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that must be so.
SOCRATES : Yet if he knows a thing, it is impossible that he should not
know it; or if he does not know it, he cannot know it. b
THEAETETUS : Yes, of course.
SOCRATES : Now take the man who judges what is false. Is he thinking
that things which he knows are not these things but some other things
which he knows —so that knowing both he is ignorant of both?
THEAETETUS : But that would be impossible, Socrates.
SOCRATES : Then is he imagining that things which he doesn’t know are
other things which he doesn’t know? Is it possible that a man who knows
neither Theaetetus nor Socrates should take it into his head that Socrates
is Theaetetus or Theaetetus Socrates?
THEAETETUS : I don’t see how that could happen. c
SOCRATES : But a man certainly doesn’t think that things he knows are
things he does not know, or again that things he doesn’t know are things
he knows.
THEAETETUS : No, that would be a very odd thing.
SOCRATES : Then in what way is false judgment still possible? There is
evidently no possibility of judgment outside the cases we have mentioned,
since everything is either a thing we know or a thing we don’t know; and
within these limits there appears to be no place for false judgment to
be possible.
THEAETETUS : That’s perfectly true.
SOCRATES : Then perhaps we had better take up a different line of inquiry;
perhaps we should proceed not by way of knowing and not-knowing, but d
by way of being and not-being?
THEAETETUS : How do you mean?
SOCRATES : Perhaps the simple fact is this: it is when a man judges about
anything things which are not, that he is inevitably judging falsely, no
matter what may be the nature of his thought in other respects.
THEAETETUS : That again is very plausible, Socrates.
SOCRATES : Now how will that be? What are we going to say, Theaetetus,
if somebody sets about examining us, and we are asked, ‘Is what these
words express possible for anyone? Can a man judge what is not, either
about one of the things which are, or just by itself?’ I suppose we shall e
reply, ‘Yes, when he is thinking, but thinking what is not true.’ Or how
shall we answer?Theaetetus 209
THEAETETUS : That’s our answer.
SOCRATES : Now does this kind of thing happen elsewhere?
THEAETETUS : What kind of thing?
SOCRATES : Well, for instance, that a man sees something, yet sees nothing.
THEAETETUS : How could he?
SOCRATES : On the contrary, in fact, if he is seeing any one thing, he must
be seeing a thing which is. Or do you think that a ‘one’ can be found
among the things which are not?
THEAETETUS : I certainly don’t.
SOCRATES : Then a man who is seeing any one thing is seeing something
which is?
THEAETETUS : Apparently.
SOCRATES : It also follows that a man who is hearing anything is hearing 189
some one thing and something which is.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : And a man who is touching anything is touching some one
thing, and a thing which is, if it is one?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that also follows.
SOCRATES : And a man who is judging is judging some one thing, is he not?
THEAETETUS : Necessarily.
SOCRATES : And a man who is judging some one thing is judging some-
thing which is?
THEAETETUS : I grant that.
SOCRATES : Then that means that a man who is judging something which
is not is judging nothing?
THEAETETUS : So it appears.
SOCRATES : But a man who is judging nothing is not judging at all.
THEAETETUS : That seems clear.
SOCRATES : And so it is not possible to judge what is not, either about b
the things which are or just by itself.
THEAETETUS : Apparently not.
SOCRATES : False judgment, then, is something different from judging
things which are not?
THEAETETUS : It looks as if it were.
SOCRATES : Then neither on this approach nor on the one we followed
just now does false judgment exist in us.
THEAETETUS : No, indeed.
SOCRATES : Then is it in this way that the thing we call by that name arises?
THEAETETUS : How?
SOCRATES : We say that there is false judgment, a kind of ‘other-judging’, c
when a man, in place of one of the things that are, has substituted in his
thought another of the things that are and asserts that it is.32In this way,
32. Reading [anti tinos] for Burnet’s [ti] at 189c1; the latter reading would yield: ‘when
a man asserts that one of the things which are is another of the things which are, having
substituted one for the other in his thought’.210 Theaetetus
he is always judging something which is, but judges one thing in place of
another; and having missed the thing which was the object of his consider-
ation, he might fairly be called one who judges falsely.
THEAETETUS : Now you seem to me to have got it quite right. When a
man judges ‘ugly’ instead of ‘beautiful’,o r ‘beautiful’ instead of ‘ugly’,
then he is truly judging what is false.
SOCRATES : Evidently, Theaetetus, you have not much opinion of me; you
don’t ﬁnd me at all alarming.
THEAETETUS : What in particular makes you say that?
SOCRATES : Well, I suppose you don’t think me capable of taking up your d
‘truly false’, and asking you whether it is possible that a thing should be
slowly swift, or heavily light, or whether anything else can possibly occur
in a way not in accordance with its own nature but in accordance with
that of its opposite and contrary to itself. But let that pass; I don’t want
your boldness to go unrewarded. You like the suggestion, you say, that
false judgment is ‘other-judging’?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I do.
SOCRATES : Then, according to your judgment, it is possible to set down
a thing in one’s thought as another thing and not itself?
THEAETETUS : Surely it is.
SOCRATES : Now when a man’s thought is accomplishing this, isn’t it e
essential that he should be thinking of either one or both of these two
things?
THEAETETUS : It is essential; either both together, or each in turn.
SOCRATES : Very good. Now by ‘thinking’ do you mean the same as I do?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean by it?
SOCRATES : A talk which the soul has with itself about the objects under
its consideration. Of course, I’m only telling you my idea in all ignorance;
but this is the kind of picture I have of it. It seems to me that the soul
when it thinks is simply carrying on a discussion in which it asks itself 190
questions and answers them itself, afﬁrms and denies. And when it arrives
at something deﬁnite, either by a gradual process or a sudden leap, when
it afﬁrms one thing consistently and without divided counsel, we call this
its judgment. So, in my view, to judge is to make a statement, and a
judgment is a statement which is not addressed to another person or
spoken aloud, but silently addressed to oneself. And what do you think?
THEAETETUS : I agree with that.
SOCRATES : So that when a man judges one thing to be another, what he
is doing, apparently, is to say to himself that the one thing is the other.
THEAETETUS : Yes, of course. b
SOCRATES : Now try to think if you have ever said to yourself ‘Surely the
beautiful is ugly’,33or ‘The unjust is certainly just’. Or—to put it in the
most general terms—have you ever tried to persuade yourself that ‘Surely
33. The Greek idiom here could be used to say either that some particular beautiful
thing is ugly, or that beauty is ugliness.Theaetetus 211
one thing is another ’? Wouldn’t the very opposite of this be the truth?
Wouldn’t the truth be that not even in your sleep have you ever gone so
far as to say to yourself ‘No doubt the odd is even ’, or anything of that kind?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s so.
SOCRATES : And do you think that anyone else, in his right mind or out c
of it, ever ventured seriously to tell himself, with the hope of winning his
own assent, that ‘A cow must be a horse ’or‘Two must be one ’?
THEAETETUS : No, indeed I don ’t.
SOCRATES : Well, then, if to make a statement to oneself is to judge, no
one who makes a statement, that is, a judgment, about both things, getting
hold of both with his soul, can state, or judge, that one is the other. And
you, in your turn, must let this form of words pass.34What I mean by it
is this: no one judges ‘The ugly is beautiful ’or makes any other such d
judgment.
THEAETETUS : All right, Socrates, I pass it; and I think you ’re right.
SOCRATES : Thus a man who has both things before his mind when he
judges cannot possibly judge that one is the other.
THEAETETUS : So it seems.
SOCRATES : But if he has only one of them before his mind in judging,
and the other is not present to him at all, he will never judge that one is
the other.
THEAETETUS : That’s true. For he would have to have hold also of the one
that is not present to his judgment.
SOCRATES : Then ‘other-judging’ is not possible for anyone either when
he has both things present to him in judgment or when he has one only. e
So, if anyone is going to de ﬁne false judgment as ‘heterodoxy’,35he will
be saying nothing. The existence of false judgment in us cannot be shown
in this way any more than by our previous approaches.
THEAETETUS : It seems not.
SOCRATES : And yet, Theaetetus, if it is not shown to exist, we shall be
driven into admitting a number of absurdities.
THEAETETUS : And what would they be?
SOCRATES : I am not going to tell you until I have tried every possible
way of looking at this matter. I should be ashamed to see us forced into 191
making the kind of admissions I mean while we are still in dif ﬁculties. If
weﬁnd what we’re after, and become free men, then we will turn round
and talk about how these things happen to other people —having secured
our own persons against ridicule. While if we can’t ﬁnd any way of
34. In the Greek the opposition here between ‘one’ and ‘the other’ is expressed by
the repetition of the word meaning ‘other’—thus yielding, literally, the unparadoxical
tautology ‘the other is other’. As Socrates refrained at 189c –d from taking up the paradoxi-
cal construal of Theaetetus’‘ truly false’, so Theaetetus must refrain from taking up this
unparadoxical construal of Socrates ’‘one is the other ’.
35. A transliteration of a variant Greek expression for ‘other-judging’ that Socrates
uses here.212 Theaetetus
extricating ourselves, then I suppose we shall be laid low, like seasick
passengers, and give ourselves into the hands of the argument and let it
trample all over us and do what it likes with us. And now let me tell you
where I see a way still open to this inquiry.
THEAETETUS : Yes, do tell me.
SOCRATES : I am going to maintain that we were wrong to agree that it
is impossible for a man to be in error through judging that things he knows b
are things he doesn’t know. In a way, it is possible.
THEAETETUS : Now I wonder if you mean the same thing as I too suspected
at the time when we suggested it was like that —I mean, that sometimes
I, who know Socrates, have seen someone else in the distance whom I
don’t know and thought it to be Socrates whom I do know. In a case like
that, the sort of thing you are referring to does happen.
SOCRATES : But didn’t we recoil from this suggestion because it made us
not know, when we do know, things which we know?
THEAETETUS : Yes, we certainly did.
SOCRATES : Then don’t let us put the case in that way; let‘s try another
way. It may prove amenable or it may be obstinate; but the fact is we are c
in such an extremity that we need to turn every argument over and over
and test it from all sides. Now see if there is anything in this. Is it possible
to learn something you didn’t know before?
THEAETETUS : Surely it is.
SOCRATES : And again another and yet another thing?
THEAETETUS : Well, why not?
SOCRATES : Now I want you to suppose, for the sake of the argument,
that we have in our souls a block of wax, larger in one person, smaller in
another, and of purer wax in one case, dirtier in another; in some men rather d
hard, in others rather soft, while in some it is of the proper consistency.
THEAETETUS : All right, I’m supposing that.
SOCRATES : We may look upon it, then, as a gift of Memory, the mother
of the Muses. We make impressions upon this of everything we wish to
remember among the things we have seen or heard or thought of ourselves;
we hold the wax under our perceptions and thoughts and take a stamp
from them, in the way in which we take the imprints of signet rings.
Whatever is impressed upon the wax we remember and know so long as
the image remains in the wax; whatever is obliterated or cannot be im- e
pressed, we forget and do not know.
THEAETETUS : Let that be our supposition.
SOCRATES : Then take the case of a man who knows these things, but is
also considering something he is seeing or hearing; and see if he might
judge falsely in this way.
THEAETETUS : In what kind of way?
SOCRATES : In thinking, of things which he knows, sometimes that they
are things which he knows and sometimes that they are things which he
doesn’t know —these cases being what at an earlier stage we wrongly
admitted to be impossible.
THEAETETUS : And what do you say now?Theaetetus 213
SOCRATES : We must begin this discussion by making certain distinctions. 192
We must make it clear that it is impossible to think (1) that a thing you
know, because you possess the record of it in your soul, but which you
are not perceiving, is another thing which you know —you have its imprint
too—but are not perceiving, (2) that a thing you know is something you
do not know and do not have the seal of, (3) that a thing you don’t know
is another thing you don’t know, (4) that a thing you don’t know is a thing
you know.
Again, it is impossible to think (1) that a thing you are perceiving is
another thing that you are perceiving, (2) that a thing you are perceiving
is a thing which you are not perceiving, (3) that a thing you are not b
perceiving is another thing you are not perceiving, (4) that a thing you
are not perceiving is a thing you are perceiving.
Yet again, it is impossible to think (1) that a thing you both know and are
perceiving, when you are holding its imprint in line with your perception of
it, is another thing which you know and are perceiving, and whose imprint
you keep in line with the perception (this indeed is even more impossible
than the former cases, if that can be), (2) that a thing which you both know
and are perceiving, and the record of which you are keeping in its true
line, is another thing you know, (3) that a thing you both know and are
perceiving and of which you have the record correctly in line as before,
is another thing you are perceiving, (4) that a thing you neither know nor c
are perceiving is another thing you neither know nor perceive, (5) that a
thing you neither know nor perceive is another thing you don’t know,
(6) that a thing you neither know nor perceive is another thing you are
not perceiving.
In all these cases, it is a sheer impossibility that there should be false
judgment. It remains that it arises, if anywhere, in the cases I am just going
to tell you.
THEAETETUS : What are they? Perhaps I may understand a little better
from them; at present, I don’t follow.
SOCRATES : In these cases of things you know: when you think (1) that
they are other things you know and are perceiving, (2) that they are things
you don’t know but are perceiving, (3) that things you both know and are d
perceiving are other things you both know and are perceiving.
THEAETETUS : Well, now you have left me further behind than ever.
SOCRATES :I’ll go over it again in another way. I know Theodorus and
remember within myself what he is like; and in the same way I know
Theaetetus. But sometimes I am seeing them and sometimes not; sometimes
I am touching them, and sometimes not; or I may hear them or perceive
them through some other sense, while at other times I have no perception
about you two at all, but remember you none the less, and know you
within myself —isn’t that so?
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly. e
SOCRATES : Now please take this ﬁrst point that I want to make clear to
you—that we sometimes perceive and sometimes do not perceive the
things that we know.214 Theaetetus
THEAETETUS : That’s true.
SOCRATES : Then as regards the things we don’t know, we often don’t
perceive them either, but often we only perceive them.
THEAETETUS : That is so, also.
SOCRATES : Now see if you can follow me a little better. Supposing Socrates 193
knows both Theodorus and Theaetetus, but is not seeing either of them,
or having any other perception about them: he could never in that case
judge within himself that Theaetetus was Theodorus. Is that sense or not?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s quite true.
SOCRATES : This, then, was the ﬁrst of the cases I was speaking of.
THEAETETUS : It was.
SOCRATES : Secondly then. Supposing I am acquainted with one of you
and not the other, and am perceiving neither of you: in that case, I could
never think the one I do know to be the one I don’t know.
THEAETETUS : That is so.
SOCRATES : Thirdly, supposing I am not acquainted with either of you, b
and am not perceiving either of you: I could not possibly think that one
of you, whom I don’t know, is another of you whom I don’t know. Now
will you please take it that you have heard all over again in succession
the other cases described before —the cases in which I shall never judge
falsely about you and Theodorus, either when I am familiar or when I am
unfamiliar with both of you; or when I know one and not the other. And
similarly with perceptions, you follow me.
THEAETETUS : I follow.
SOCRATES : So there remains the possibility of false judgment in this case.
I know both you and Theodorus; I have your signs upon that block of c
wax, like the imprints of rings. Then I see you both in the distance, but
cannot see you well enough; but I am in a hurry to refer the proper sign
to the proper visual perception, and so get this ﬁtted into the trace of itself,
that recognition may take place. This I fail to do; I get them out of line,
applying the visual perception of the one to the sign of the other. It is like
people putting their shoes on the wrong feet, or like what happens when
we look at things in mirrors, when left and right change places. It is then d
that ‘heterodoxy’ or false judgment arises.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that seems very likely, Socrates; it is an awfully good
description of what happens to the judgment.
SOCRATES : Then, again, supposing I know both of you, and am also
perceiving one of you, and not the other, but am not keeping my knowledge
of the former in line with my perception —that’s the expression I used
before and you didn’t understand me then.
THEAETETUS : No, I certainly didn’t.
SOCRATES : Well, I was saying that if you know one man and perceive
him as well, and keep your knowledge of him in line with your perception, e
you will never take him for some other person whom you know and are
perceiving, and the knowledge of whom you are holding straight with the
perception. Wasn’t that so?
THEAETETUS : Yes.Theaetetus 215
SOCRATES : There remained, I take it, the case we have just mentioned
where false judgment arises in the following manner: you know both men 194
and you are looking at both, or having some other perception of them;
and you don’t hold the two signs each in line with its own perception,
but like a bad archer you shoot beside the mark and miss—which is
precisely what we call falsehood.
THEAETETUS : Naturally so.
SOCRATES : And when for one of the signs there is also a present perception
but there is not for the other, and you try to ﬁt to the present perception the
sign belonging to the absent perception, in all such cases thought is in error.
We may sum up thus: it seems that in the case of things we do not b
know and have never perceived, there is no possibility of error or of false
judgment, if what we are saying is at all sound; it is in cases where we
both know things and are perceiving them that judgment is erratic and
varies between truth and falsity. When it brings together the proper stamps
and records directly and in straight lines, it is true; when it does so obliquely
and crosswise, it is false.
THEAETETUS : Well, isn’t that beautiful, Socrates?
SOCRATES : Ah, when you’ve heard what is coming next, you will say so c
all the more. For true judgment is beautiful, right enough, and error is ugly.
THEAETETUS : No doubt about that.
SOCRATES : Well, this, then, they say, is why the two things occur. In some
men, the wax in the soul is deep and abundant, smooth and worked to
the proper consistency; and when the things that come through the senses
are imprinted upon this ‘heart’ of the soul—as Homer calls it, hinting at
the likeness to the wax36—the signs that are made in it are lasting, because d
they are clear and have sufﬁcient depth. Men with such souls learn easily
and remember what they learn; they do not get the signs out of line with
the perceptions, but judge truly. As the signs are distinct and there is
plenty of room for them, they quickly assign each thing to its own impress
in the wax—the things in question being, of course, what we call the things
that are and these people being the ones we call wise.
Or do you feel any doubts about this?
THEAETETUS : No, I ﬁnd it extraordinarily convincing.
SOCRATES : But it is a different matter when a man’s ‘heart’ is ‘shaggy’ e
(the kind of heart our marvellously knowing poet praises), or when it is
dirty and of impure wax; or when it is very soft or hard. Persons in whom
the wax is soft are quick to learn but quick to forget; when the wax is
hard, the opposite happens. Those in whom it is ‘shaggy’ and rugged, a
stony thing with earth or ﬁlth mixed all through it, have indistinct impres-
sions. So too if the wax is hard, for then the impressions have no depth;
similarly they are indistinct if the wax is soft, because they quickly run 195
together and are blurred. If, in addition to all this, the impresses in the
wax are crowded upon each other for lack of space, because it is only
36.Iliad ii.851, xvi.554. The word for ‘heart’ attributed to Homer here is kear, which has
a superﬁcial resemblance to the word for wax, ke¯ros.216 Theaetetus
some little scrap of a soul, they are even more indistinct. All such people
are liable to false judgment. When they see or hear or think of anything,
they can’t quickly allot each thing to each impress; they are slow and allot
things to impresses which do not belong to them, misseeing, mishearing
and misthinking most of them —and these in turn are the ones we describe
as in error about the things that are and ignorant.
THEAETETUS : That’s exactly it, Socrates; no man could improve on b
your account.
SOCRATES : Then are we to say that false judgments do exist in us?
THEAETETUS : Yes, most emphatically.
SOCRATES : And true ones, of course?
THEAETETUS : And true ones.
SOCRATES : And we think we have now reached a satisfactory agreement,
when we say that these two kinds of judgment certainly exist?
THEAETETUS : There’s no earthly doubt about it, Socrates.
SOCRATES : Theaetetus, I’m afraid a garrulous man is really an awful nui-
sance.
THEAETETUS : Why, what are you talking about?
SOCRATES :I’m annoyed at my own stupidity —my own true garrulous- c
ness. What else could you call it when a man will keep dragging arguments
up and down, because he is too slow-witted to reach any conviction, and
will not be pulled off any of them?
THEAETETUS : But why should yoube annoyed?
SOCRATES : I am not only annoyed; I am alarmed. I am afraid of what I
may say if someone asks me: ‘So, Socrates, you’ve discovered false judg-
ment, have you? You have found that it arises not in the relation of
perceptions to one another, or of thoughts to one another, but in the d
connecting of perception with thought?’ I believe I am very likely to say
‘Yes’, with an air of ﬂattering myself upon our having made some beauti-
ful discovery.
THEAETETUS : Well, Socrates, what you have just shown us looks to me
quite a presentable thing anyway.
SOCRATES :‘You mean’, he goes on, ‘that we would never suppose that
a man we are merely thinking of but not seeing is a horse which again
we are not seeing or touching, but just thinking of and not perceiving
anything else about it?’ I suppose I shall agree that we do mean this.
THEAETETUS : Yes, and quite rightly.
SOCRATES :’Well then,’ he goes on, ‘doesn’t it follow from this theory e
that a man couldn’t possibly suppose that eleven, which he is merely
thinking about, is twelve, which again he is merely thinking about?’ Come
now, you answer.
THEAETETUS : Well, my answer will be that someone who is seeing or
touching them could suppose that eleven are twelve, but not with those that
he has in his thought: he would never judge this in that way about them.
SOCRATES : Well, now, take the case where a man is considering ﬁve and 196
seven within himself —I don’t mean seven men and ﬁve men, or anythingTheaetetus 217
of that sort, but ﬁve and seven themselves; the records, as we allege, in
that waxen block, things among which it is not possible that there should
be false judgment. Suppose he is talking to himself about them, and asking
himself how many they are. Do you think that in such a case it has ever
happened that one man thought they were eleven and said so, while
another thought and said that they were twelve? Or do all men say and
all men think that they are twelve?
THEAETETUS : Oh, good Heavens, no; lots of people would make them b
eleven. And with larger numbers they go wrong still more often —for I
suppose what you say is intended to apply to all numbers.
SOCRATES : Quite right. And I want you to consider whether what happens
here is not just this, that a man thinks that twelve itself, the one on the
waxen block, is eleven.
THEAETETUS : It certainly looks as if he does.
SOCRATES : Then haven’t we come back to the things we were saying at
the outset? You see, anyone to whom this happens is thinking that one
thing he knows is another thing he knows. And this we said was impossible;
in fact, it was just this consideration which led us to exclude the possibility
of false judgment, because, if admitted, it would mean that the same man c
must, at one and the same time, both know and not know the same objects.
THEAETETUS : That’s perfectly true.
SOCRATES : Then we shall have to say that false judgment is something
other than a misapplication of thought to perception; because if this were
so, we could never be in error so long as we remained within our thoughts
themselves. But as the matter now stands, either there is no such thing
as false judgment; or a man may not know what he knows. Which do
you choose?
THEAETETUS : You are offering me an impossible choice, Socrates.
SOCRATES : But I’m afraid the argument will not permit both. Still — d
we must stop at nothing; supposing now we were to set about being
quite shameless?
THEAETETUS : How?
SOCRATES : By consenting to say what knowing is like.
THEAETETUS : And why should that be shameless?
SOCRATES : You don’t seem to realize that our whole discussion from the
beginning has been an inquiry about knowledge, on the assumption that
we do not yet know what it is.
THEAETETUS :O hb u tId o .
SOCRATES : Well, then, don’t you think it is a shameless thing that we,
who don’t know what knowledge is, should pronounce on what knowing e
is like? But as a matter of fact, Theaetetus, for some time past our whole
method of discussion has been tainted. Time and again we have said ‘we
are acquainted with’ and ‘we are not acquainted with’, ‘we know’ and
‘we do not know’, as if we could to some extent understand one another
while we are still ignorant of what knowledge is. Or here’s another example,
if you like: at this very moment, we have again used the words ‘to be218 Theaetetus
ignorant of’, and ‘to understand’, as if these were quite proper expressions
for us when we are deprived of knowledge.
THEAETETUS : But how are you going to carry on the discussion at all,
Socrates, if you keep off these words?
SOCRATES : Quite impossible, for a man like me; but if I were one of the 197
experts in contradiction, I might be able to. If one of those gentlemen were
present, he would have commanded us to refrain from them, and would
keep coming down upon us heavily for the faults I’m referring to. But
since we are no good anyway, why don’t I make bold to tell you what
knowing is like? It seems to me that this might be of some help.
THEAETETUS : Then do be bold, please. And if you don’t keep from using
these words, we’ll forgive you all right.
SOCRATES : Well, then, have you heard what people are saying nowadays
that knowing is?
THEAETETUS : I dare say I have; but I don’t remember it at the moment.
SOCRATES : Well, they say, of course, that it is ‘the having of knowledge’. b
THEAETETUS : Oh, yes, that’s true.
SOCRATES : Let us make a slight change; let us say ‘the possession of
knowledge’.
THEAETETUS : And how would you say that was different from the ﬁrst
way of putting it?
SOCRATES : Perhaps it isn’t at all; but I will tell you what I think the
difference is, and then you must help me to examine it.
THEAETETUS : All right —if I can.
SOCRATES : Well, then, to ‘possess’ doesn’t seem to me to be the same as
to‘have’. For instance, suppose a man has bought a coat and it is at his
disposal but he is not wearing it; we would not say that he ‘has’ it on, but
we would say he ‘possesses’ it.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that would be correct.
SOCRATES : Now look here: is it possible in this way to possess knowledge c
and not ‘have’ it? Suppose a man were to hunt wild birds, pigeons or
something, and make an aviary for them at his house and look after them
there; then, in a sense, I suppose, we might say he ‘has’ them all the time,
because of course he possesses them. Isn’t that so?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But in another sense he ‘has’ none of them; it is only that he
has acquired a certain power in respect of them, because he has got them
under his control in an enclosure of his own. That is to say, he has the d
power to hunt for any one he likes at any time, and take and ‘have’ it
whenever he chooses, and let it go again; and this he can do as often as
he likes.
THEAETETUS : That is so.
SOCRATES : Well a little while ago we were equipping souls with I don’t
know what sort of a waxen device. Now let us make in each soul a sort
of aviary of all kinds of birds; some in ﬂocks separate from the others,Theaetetus 219
some in small groups, and others ﬂying about singly here and there among
all the rest.
THEAETETUS : All right, let us suppose it made. What then? e
SOCRATES : Then we must say that when we are children this receptacle
is empty; and by the birds we must understand pieces of knowledge.
When anyone takes possession of a piece of knowledge and shuts it up
in the pen, we should say that he has learned or has found out the thing
of which this is the knowledge; and knowing, we should say, is this.
THEAETETUS : That’s given, then.
SOCRATES : Now think: when he hunts again for any one of the pieces of 198
knowledge that he chooses, and takes it and ‘has’ it, then lets it go again,
what words are appropriate here? The same as before, when he took
possession of the knowledge, or different ones? —You will see my point
more clearly in this way. There is an art you call arithmetic, isn’t there?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Now I want you to think of this as a hunt for pieces of
knowledge concerning everything odd and even.
THEAETETUS : All right, I will.
SOCRATES : It is by virtue of this art, I suppose, that a man both has under b
his control pieces of knowledge concerning numbers and also hands them
over to others?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : And we call it ‘teaching’ when a man hands them over to
others, and ‘learning’ when he gets them handed over to him; and when
he‘has’ them through possessing them in this aviary of ours, we call
that ‘knowing’.
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly.
SOCRATES : Now you must give your attention to what is coming next.
It must surely be true that a man who has completely mastered arithmetic
knows all numbers? Because there are pieces of knowledge covering all
numbers in his soul.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
SOCRATES : And a man so trained may proceed to do some counting, c
either counting to himself the numbers themselves, or counting something
else, one of the external things which have number?
THEAETETUS : Yes, surely.
SOCRATES : And counting we shall take to be simply a matter of consider-
ing how large a number actually is?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Then it looks as if this man were considering something which
he knows as if he did not know it (for we have granted that he knows all
numbers). I’ve no doubt you’ve had such puzzles put to you.
THEAETETUS : I have, yes.
SOCRATES : Then using our image of possessing and hunting for the pi- d
geons, we shall say that there are two phases of hunting; one before you220 Theaetetus
have possession in order to get possession, and another when you already
possess in order to catch and have in your hands what you previously
acquired. And in this way even with things you learned and got the
knowledge of long ago and have known ever since, it is possible to learn
them —these same things —all over again. You can take up again and ‘have’
that knowledge of each of them which you acquired long ago but had not
ready to hand in your thought, can’t you?
THEAETETUS : True.
SOCRATES : Now this is what I meant by my question a moment ago. e
What terms ought we to use about them when we speak of what the
arithmetician does when he proceeds to count, or the scholar when he
proceeds to read something? Here, it seems, a man who knows something
is setting out to learn again from himself things which he already knows.
THEAETETUS : But that would be a very odd thing, Socrates.
SOCRATES : But are we to say that it is things which he does not know
that such a man is going to read and count —remembering that we have 199
granted him knowledge of all letters and all numbers?
THEAETETUS : That wouldn’t be reasonable, either.
SOCRATES : Then would you like us to take this line? Suppose we say we
do not mind at all about the names; let people drag around the terms
‘knowing’ and ‘learning’ to their heart’s content. We have determined that
to‘possess’ knowledge is one thing and to ‘have’ it is another; accordingly
we maintain that it is impossible for anyone not to possess that which he
has possession of, and thus, it never happens that he does not know
something he knows. But he may yet make a false judgment about it. This
is because it is possible for him to ‘have’, not the knowledge of this thing, b
but another piece of knowledge instead. When he is hunting for one piece
of knowledge, it may happen, as they ﬂy about, that he makes a mistake
and gets hold of one instead of another. It was this that happened when
he thought eleven was twelve. He got hold of the knowledge of eleven
that was in him, instead of the knowledge of twelve, as you might catch
a ring-dove instead of a pigeon.
THEAETETUS : Yes; that is reasonable, now.
SOCRATES : But when he gets hold of the one he is trying to get hold of,
then he is free from error; when he does that, he is judging what is. In
this way, both true and false judgment exist; and the things that worried c
us before no longer stand in our way. I daresay you’ll agree with me? Or,
if not, what line will you take?
THEAETETUS : I agree.
SOCRATES : Yes; we have now got rid of this ‘not knowing what one
knows’. For we now ﬁnd that at no point does it happen that we do not
possess what we possess, whether we are in error about anything or not.
But it looks to me as if something else more alarming is by way of coming
upon us.
THEAETETUS : What’s that?Theaetetus 221
SOCRATES : I mean, what is involved if false judgment is going to become
a matter of an interchange of pieces of knowledge.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
SOCRATES : To begin with, it follows that a man who has knowledge of d
something is ignorant of this very thing not through want of knowledge
but actually in virtue of his knowledge. Secondly, he judges that this is
something else and that the other thing is it. Now surely this is utterly
unreasonable; it means that the soul, when knowledge becomes present
to it, knows nothing and is wholly ignorant. According to this argument,
there is no reason why an accession of ignorance should not make one
know something, or of blindness make one see something, if knowledge
is ever going to make a man ignorant.
THEAETETUS : Well, perhaps, Socrates, it wasn’t a happy thought to make e
the birds only pieces of knowledge. Perhaps we ought to have supposed
that there are pieces of ignorance also ﬂying about in the soul along with
them, and what happens is that the hunter sometimes catches a piece of
knowledge and sometimes a piece of ignorance concerning the same thing;
and the ignorance makes him judge falsely, while the knowledge makes
him judge truly.
SOCRATES : I can hardly refrain from expressing my admiration of you,
Theaetetus; but do think again about that. Let us suppose it is as you say:
then, you maintain, the man who catches a piece of ignorance will judge 200
falsely. Is that it?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But presumably he will not think he is judging falsely?
THEAETETUS : No, of course he won’t.
SOCRATES : He will think he is judging what is true; and his attitude
towards the things about which he is in error will be as if he knew them.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
SOCRATES : He will think he has hunted down and ‘has’ a piece of knowl-
edge and not a piece of ignorance.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s clear.
SOCRATES : So, after going a long way round, we are back at our original
difﬁculty. Our friend the expert in refutation will laugh. ‘My very good b
people,’ he will say, ‘do you mean that a man who knows both knowledge
and ignorance is thinking that one of them which he knows is the other
which he knows? Or is it that he knows neither, and judges the one he
doesn’t know to be the other which he doesn’t know? Or is it that he
knows one and not the other, and judges that the one he knows is the one
he doesn’t know? Or does he think that the one he doesn’t know is the
one he does? Or are you going to start all over again and tell me that
there’s another set of pieces of knowledge concerning pieces of knowledge
and ignorance, which a man may possess shut up in some other ridiculous
aviaries or waxen devices, which he knows so long as he possesses them c
though he may not have them ready to hand in his soul —and in this way222 Theaetetus
end up forced to come running round to the same place over and over again
and never get any further?’ What are we going to say to that, Theaetetus?
THEAETETUS : Oh, dear me, Socrates, I don’t know what one ought to say.
SOCRATES : Then don’t you think, my boy, that the argument is perhaps
dealing out a little proper chastisement, and showing us that we were
wrong to leave the question about knowledge and proceed to inquire into d
false judgment ﬁrst? While as a matter of fact it’s impossible to know this
until we have an adequate grasp of what knowledge is.
THEAETETUS : Well, at the moment, Socrates, I feel bound to believe you.
SOCRATES : Then, to go back to the beginning, what are we going to say
knowledge is?—We are not, I suppose, going to give up yet?
THEAETETUS : Certainly not, unless you give up yourself.
SOCRATES : Tell me, then, how could we deﬁne it with the least risk of
contradicting ourselves?
THEAETETUS : In the way we were attempting before, Socrates; I can’t e
think of any other.
SOCRATES : In what way do you mean?
THEAETETUS : By saying that knowledge is true judgment. Judging truly
is at least something free of mistakes, I take it, and everything that results
from it is admirable and good.
SOCRATES : Well, Theaetetus, as the man who was leading the way across
the river said, ‘It will show you.’37If we go on and track this down, perhaps 201
we may stumble on what we are looking for; if we stay where we are,
nothing will come clear.
THEAETETUS : You’re right; let’s go on and consider it.
SOCRATES : Well, this won’t take long to consider, anyway; there is a
whole art indicating to you that knowledge is not what you say.
THEAETETUS : How’s that? What art do you mean?
SOCRATES : The art of the greatest representatives of wisdom—the men
called orators and lawyers. These men, I take it, use their art to produce
conviction not by teaching people, but by making them judge whatever
they themselves choose. Or do you think there are any teachers so clever
that within the short time allowed by the clock they can teach adequately b
to people who were not eye-witnesses the truth of what happened to
people who have been robbed or assaulted?
THEAETETUS : No, I don’t think they possibly could; but they might be
able to persuade them.
SOCRATES : And by ‘persuading them’, you mean ‘causing them to judge’,
don’t you?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
SOCRATES : Then suppose a jury has been justly persuaded of some matter
which only an eye-witness could know, and which cannot otherwise be
37. According to the scholiast the story was: some travellers came to the bank of a river,
which they wished to cross at the ford; one of them asked the guide, ‘Is the water deep?’
He said, ‘It will show you’, i.e., you must try it for yourself.Theaetetus 223
known; suppose they come to their decision upon hearsay, forming a c
true judgment: then they have decided the case without knowledge, but,
granted they did their job well, being correctly persuaded?
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly.
SOCRATES : But, my dear lad, they couldn ’t have done that if true judgment
is the same thing as knowledge; in that case the best juryman in the world
couldn’t form a correct judgment without knowledge. So it seems they
must be different things.
THEAETETUS : Oh, yes, Socrates, that ’s just what I once heard a man say;
I had forgotten, but now it ’s coming back to me. He said that it is true d
judgment with an account38that is knowledge; true judgment without an
account falls outside of knowledge. And he said that the things of which
there is no account are not knowable (yes, he actually called them that),39
while those which have an account are knowable.
SOCRATES : Very good indeed. Now tell me, how did he distinguish these
knowables and unknowables? I want to see if you and I have heard the
same version.
THEAETETUS : I don’t know if I can ﬁnd that out; but I think I could follow
if someone explained it.
SOCRATES : Listen then to a dream in return for a dream. In my dream,
too, I thought I was listening to people saying that the primary elements, e
as it were, of which we and everything else are composed, have no account.
Each of them, in itself, can only be named; it is not possible to say anything
else of it, either that it is or that it is not. That would mean that we were 202
adding being or not-being to it; whereas we must not attach anything, if
we are to speak of that thing itself alone. Indeed we ought not to apply
to it even such words as ‘itself’ or‘that’, ‘each’, ‘alone’,o r‘this’,o ra n y
other of the many words of this kind; for these go the round and are
applied to all things alike, being other than the things to which they are
added, whereas if it were possible to express the element itself and it had
its own proprietary account, it would have to be expressed without any
other thing. As it is, however, it is impossible that any of the primaries b
should be expressed in an account; it can only be named, for a name is
all that it has. But with the things composed of these, it is another matter.
Here, just in the same way as the elements themselves are woven together,
so their names may be woven together and become an account of some-
thing —an account being essentially a complex of names. Thus the elements
are unaccountable and unknowable, but they are perceivable, whereas the
38.‘Account’ translates logos, which can also mean ‘statement,’‘ argument’, ‘speech’,
and ‘discourse’.
39. The parenthesis may alternatively be translated: ‘(that was the word he used) ’. The
translation in the text expresses surprise about the claim that some things are not know-
able at all. The alternative translation calls attention to the particular Greek word used
for‘knowable’.224 Theaetetus
complexes are both knowable and expressible and can be the objects of
true judgment.
Now when a man gets a true judgment about something without an c
account, his soul is in a state of truth as regards that thing, but he does
not know it; for someone who cannot give and take an account of a thing
is ignorant about it. But when he has also got an account of it, he is capable
of all this and is made perfect in knowledge. Was the dream you heard
the same as this or a different one?
THEAETETUS : No, it was the same in every respect.
SOCRATES : Do you like this then, and do you suggest that knowledge is
true judgment with an account?
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly.
SOCRATES : Theaetetus, can it be that all in a moment, you and I have d
today laid hands upon something which many a wise man has searched
for in the past —and gone gray before he found it?
THEAETETUS : Well, it does seem to me anyway, Socrates, that what has
just been said puts the matter very well.
SOCRATES : And it seems likely enough that the matter is really so; for what
knowledge could there be apart from an account and correct judgment? But
there is one of the things said which I don ’t like.
THEAETETUS : And what’s that?
SOCRATES : What looks like the subtlest point of all —that the elements
are unknowable and the complexes knowable. e
THEAETETUS : And won’t that do?
SOCRATES : We must make sure; because, you see, we do have as hostages
for this theory the original models that were used when all these statements
were made.
THEAETETUS : What models?
SOCRATES : Letters —the elements of language —and syllables.40It must
have been these, mustn’t it, that the author of our theory had in view —
it couldn’t have been anything else?
THEAETETUS : No, he must have been thinking of letters and syllables.
SOCRATES : Let’s take and examine them then. Or rather let us examine 203
ourselves, and ask ourselves whether we really learned our letters in this
way or not. Now, to begin with, one can give an account of the syllables
but not of the letters —is that it?
THEAETETUS : Well, perhaps.
SOCRATES : It most certainly looks like that to me. At any rate, supposing
you were asked about the ﬁrst syllable of ‘Socrates’: ‘Tell me, Theaetetus,
what is SO?’ What would you answer to that?
THEAETETUS : That it’s S and O.
SOCRATES : And there you have an account of the syllable?
40.‘Letters’ translates stoicheia, which can also mean ‘elements’ more generally (and
is so translated sometimes below). ‘Syllables’: in Greek sullabai, also translated below
as‘complexes.’Theaetetus 225
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Come along then, and let us have the account of S in the b
same way.
THEAETETUS : How cananyone give the letters of a letter? S is just one of
the voiceless letters, Socrates, a mere sound like a hissing of the tongue.
B again has neither voice nor sound, and that ’s true of most letters. So the
statement that they themselves are unaccountable holds perfectly good.
Even the seven clearest have only voice; no sort of account whatever can
be given of them.41
SOCRATES : So here, my friend, we have established a point about
knowledge.
THEAETETUS : We do appear to have done so.
SOCRATES : Well then: we have shown that the syllable is knowable but c
not the letter —is that all right?
THEAETETUS : It seems the natural conclusion, anyway.
SOCRATES : Look here, what do we mean by ‘the syllable’? The two letters
(or if there are more, all the letters)? Or do we mean some single form
produced by their combination?
THEAETETUS : I think we mean all the letters.
SOCRATES : Then take the case of the two letters, S and O; these two are
theﬁrst syllable of my name. If a man knows the syllable, he must know
both the letters?
THEAETETUS : Of course. d
SOCRATES : So he knows S and O.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But can it be that he is ignorant of each one, and knows the
two of them without knowing either?
THEAETETUS : That would be a strange and unaccountable thing, Socrates.
SOCRATES : And yet, supposing it is necessary to know each in order to
know both, then it is absolutely necessary that anyone who is ever to know
a syllable must ﬁrst get to know the letters. And in admitting this, we
shall ﬁnd that our beautiful theory has taken to its heels and got clean
away from us.
THEAETETUS : And very suddenly too. e
SOCRATES : Yes; we are not keeping a proper watch on it. Perhaps we
ought not to have supposed the syllable to be the letters; perhaps we ought
to have made it some single form produced out of them, having its own
single nature —something different from the letters.
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly; that might be more like it.
SOCRATES : We must look into the matter; we have no right to betray a
great and imposing theory in this faint-hearted manner.
THEAETETUS : Certainly not.
41. I.e., the seven vowels of ancient Greek, as contrasted with two classes of consonant:
mutes like B, which cannot be pronounced without a vowel, and semivowels like S,
which can.226 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : Then let it be as we are now suggesting. Let the complex be 204
a single form resulting from the combination of the several elements when
they ﬁt together; and let this hold both of language and of things in general.
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly.
SOCRATES : Then it must have no parts.
THEAETETUS : Why is that, now?
SOCRATES : Because when a thing has parts, the whole is necessarily all
the parts. Or do you mean by ‘the whole’ also a single form arising out
of the parts, yet different from all the parts?
THEAETETUS : I do.
SOCRATES : Now do you call ‘sum’42and ‘whole’ the same thing or differ- b
ent things?
THEAETETUS : I don’t feel at all certain; but as you keep telling me to
answer up with a good will, I will take a risk and say they are different.
SOCRATES : Your good will, Theaetetus, is all that it should be. Now we
must see if your answer is too.
THEAETETUS : We must, of course.
SOCRATES : As the argument stands at present, the whole will be different
from the sum?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Well now, is there any difference between all the things and
the sum? For instance, when we say ‘one, two, three, four, ﬁve, six’; or, c
‘twice three’,o r‘three times two’, ‘four and two’, ‘three and two and one ’;
are we speaking of the same thing in all these cases or different things?
THEAETETUS : The same thing.
SOCRATES : That is, six?
THEAETETUS : Precisely.
SOCRATES : Then with each expression have we not spoken of all the six?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : And when we speak of them all, aren’t we speaking of a sum?
THEAETETUS : We must be.
SOCRATES : That is, six?
THEAETETUS : Precisely.
SOCRATES : Then in all things made up of number, at any rate, by ‘the d
sum’ and ‘all of them’ we mean the same thing?
THEAETETUS : So it seems.
SOCRATES : Now let us talk about them in this way. The number of an
acre is the same thing as an acre, isn ’t it?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Similarly with a mile.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
42. The word translated ‘sum’ (pan) and the word translated ‘all’ (panta) in the phrase
‘all the parts ’are singular and plural forms of the same Greek word.Theaetetus 227
SOCRATES : And the number of an army is the same as the army? And
so always with things of this sort; their total number is the sum that each
of them is.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : But is the number of each anything other than its parts? e
THEAETETUS : No.
SOCRATES : Now things which have parts consist of parts?
THEAETETUS : That seems true.
SOCRATES : And it is agreed that all the parts are the sum, seeing that the
total number is to be the sum.
THEAETETUS : That is so.
SOCRATES : Then the whole does not consist of parts. For if it did, it would
be all the parts and so would be a sum.
THEAETETUS : It looks as if it doesn ’t.
SOCRATES : But can a part, as such, be a part of anything but the whole?
THEAETETUS : Yes; of the sum.
SOCRATES : You are putting up a good ﬁght anyway, Theaetetus. But this 205
sum now —isn’t it just when there is nothing lacking that it is a sum?
THEAETETUS : Yes, necessarily.
SOCRATES : And won’t this very same thing —that from which nothing
anywhere is lacking —be a whole? While a thing from which something
is absent is neither a whole nor a sum —the same consequence having
followed from the same condition in both cases at once?
THEAETETUS : Well, it doesn ’t seem to me now that there can be any
difference between whole and sum.
SOCRATES : Very well. Now were we not saying43that in the case of a
thing that has parts, both the whole and the sum will be all the parts?
THEAETETUS : Yes, certainly.
SOCRATES : Now come back to the thing I was trying to get at just now.44
Supposing the syllable is not just its letters, doesn ’t it follow that it cannot b
contain the letters as parts of itself? Alternatively, if it is the same as the
letters, it must be equally knowable with them?
THEAETETUS : That is so.
SOCRATES : Well, wasn ’t it just in order to avoid this result that we sup-
posed it different from the letters?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Well then, if the letters are not parts of the syllable, can you
tell me of any other things, not its letters, which are?
THEAETETUS : No, indeed. If I were to admit that it had component parts,
Socrates, it would be ridiculous, of course, to set aside the letters and look
for other components.
43. At 204a.
44. See 203d –e.228 Theaetetus
SOCRATES : Then, Theaetetus, according to our present argument, a sylla- c
ble is an absolutely single form, indivisible into parts.
THEAETETUS : It looks like it.
SOCRATES : Now, my friend, a little while ago, if you remember, we were
inclined to accept a certain proposition which we thought put the matter
very well —I mean the statement that no account can be given of the
primaries of which other things are constituted, because each of them is
in itself incomposite; and that it would be incorrect to apply even the term
‘being’ to it when we spoke of it or the term ‘this’, because these terms
signify different and alien things; and that is the reason why a primary is
an unaccountable and unknowable thing. Do you remember?
THEAETETUS : I remember.
SOCRATES : And is that the reason also why it is single in form and d
indivisible into parts or is there some other reason for that?45I can see no
other myself.
THEAETETUS : No, there really doesn ’t seem to be any other.
SOCRATES : And hasn ’t the complex now fallen into the same class as the
primary, seeing it has no parts and is a single form?
THEAETETUS : Yes, it certainly has.
SOCRATES : Well now, if the complex is both many elements and a whole,
with them as its parts, then both complexes and elements are equally
capable of being known and expressed, since all the parts turned out to
be the same thing as the whole.
THEAETETUS : Yes, surely. e
SOCRATES : But if, on the other hand, the complex is single and without
parts, then complexes and elements are equally unaccountable and un-
knowable —both of them for the same reason.
THEAETETUS : I can’t dispute that.
SOCRATES : Then if anyone tries to tell us that the complex can be known
and expressed, while the contrary is true of the element, we had better
not listen to him.
THEAETETUS : No, we’d better not, if we go along with the argument.
SOCRATES : And, more than this, wouldn ’t you more easily believe some- 206
body who made the contrary statement, because of what you know of
your own experience in learning to read and write?
THEAETETUS : What kind of thing do you mean?
SOCRATES : I mean that when you were learning you spent your time just
precisely in trying to distinguish, by both eye and ear, each individual
letter in itself so that you might not be bewildered by their different
positions in written and spoken words.
THEAETETUS : That’s perfectly true.
45. Alternatively (accepting the conjecture of tofortouto at 205d): ‘And is there any
other reason for this than that it is single in form and indivisible into parts? ’Theaetetus 229
SOCRATES : And at the music-teacher ’s, wasn’t the ﬁnished pupil the one
who would follow each note and tell to which string it belonged —the b
notes being generally admitted to be the elements in music?
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s just what it amounted to.
SOCRATES : Then if the proper procedure is to take such elements and
complexes as we ourselves have experience of, and make an inference
from them to the rest, we shall say that the elements are much more clearly
known, and the knowledge of them is more decisive for the mastery of
any branch of study than knowledge of the complex. And if anyone main-
tains that the complex is by nature knowable, and the element unknowable,
we shall regard this as tomfoolery, whether it is intended to be or not.
THEAETETUS : Oh, quite.
SOCRATES : I think that might be proved in other ways too. But we mustn ’t c
let them distract us from the problem before us. We wanted to see what
can be meant by the proposition that it is in the addition of an account to
a true judgment that knowledge is perfected.
THEAETETUS : Well yes, we must try to see that.
SOCRATES : Come then, what are we intended to understand by an ‘ac-
count’? I think it must be one of three meanings.
THEAETETUS : What are they?
SOCRATES : The ﬁrst would be, making one’s thought apparent vocally d
by means of words and verbal expressions —when a man impresses an
image of his judgment upon the stream of speech, like re ﬂections upon
water or in a mirror. Don ’t you think this kind of thing is an account?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I do. At least, a man who does this is said to be giving
an account.46
SOCRATES : But isn’t that a thing that everyone is able to do more or less
readily —I mean, indicate what he thinks about a thing, if he is not deaf
or dumb to begin with? And that being so, anyone at all who makes a
correct judgment will turn out to have it ‘together with an account ’; correct e
judgment without knowledge will no longer be found anywhere.
THEAETETUS : True.
SOCRATES : Well then, we mustn’t be too ready to condemn the author
of the de ﬁnition of knowledge now before us for talking nonsense. Perhaps
he didn’t mean this; perhaps he meant being able, when questioned about 207
what a thing is, to give an answer by reference to its elements.
THEAETETUS : As for example, Socrates?
SOCRATES : As for example, what Hesiod is doing when he says, ‘One
hundred are the timbers of a wagon. ’47Now I couldn’t say what they are;
and I don’t suppose you could either. If you and I were asked what a
46.‘Giving an account’ here translates legein, the ordinary Greek word for ‘say, speak,
speak of ’, which corresponds to logos in its wider meanings ‘speech, discourse, statement ’.
47.Works and Days 456.230 Theaetetus
wagon is, we should be satisﬁed if we could answer, ‘Wheels, axle, body,
rails, yoke.’
THEAETETUS : Yes, surely.
SOCRATES : But he might think us ridiculous, just as he would if we were
asked what your name is, and replied by giving the syllables. In that case,
he would think us ridiculous because although we might be correct in our b
judgment and our expression of it, we should be fancying ourselves as
scholars, thinking we knew and were expressing a scholar’s account of
Theaetetus’ name. Whereas in fact no one gives an account of a thing with
knowledge till, in addition to his true judgment, he goes right through
the thing element by element —as I think we said before.
THEAETETUS : We did, yes.
SOCRATES : In the same way, in the example of the wagon, he would say
that we have indeed correct judgment; but it is the man who can explore c
its being by going through those hundred items who has made the addition
which adds an account to his true judgment. It is this man who has passed
from mere judgment to expert knowledge of the being of a wagon; and
he has done so in virtue of having gone over the whole by means of
the elements.
THEAETETUS : And doesn’t that seem sound to you, Socrates?
SOCRATES : Well, tell me if it seems sound to you, my friend. Tell me if
you are prepared to accept the view that an account is a matter of going
through a thing element by element, while going through it by ‘syllables’
or larger divisions falls short of being an account. Then we shall be able d
to discuss it.
THEAETETUS :I’m certainly prepared to accept that.
SOCRATES : And do you at the same time think that a man has knowledge
of anything when he believes the same thing now to be part of one thing
and now part of something else? Or when he judges that now one thing
and now something different belongs to one and the same object?
THEAETETUS : No, indeed I don’t.
SOCRATES : Then have you forgotten that at ﬁrst when you were learning
to read and write that is just what you and the other boys used to do?
THEAETETUS : You mean we used to think that sometimes one letter
and sometimes another belonged to the same syllable, and used to e
put the same letter sometimes into its proper syllable and sometimes
into another?
SOCRATES : Yes, that is what I mean.
THEAETETUS : Well, I certainly haven’t forgotten; and I don’t think people
at that stage can be said to have knowledge yet.
SOCRATES : Well, suppose now that someone who is at this sort of stage
is writing the name ‘Theaetetus’; he thinks he ought to write THE and
does so. Then suppose another time he is trying to write ‘Theodorus’, and 208
this time he thinks he should write TE and proceeds to do so. Are we
going to say that he knows the ﬁrst syllable of your names?Theaetetus 231
THEAETETUS : No. We’ve admitted that anyone who is at that stage has
not yet knowledge.
SOCRATES : And is there anything to prevent the same person being in
that situation as regards the second and third and fourth syllables?
THEAETETUS : No, nothing.
SOCRATES : Now at the time when he does this, he will be writing ‘Theaete-
tus’not only with correct judgment, but with command of the way through
its letters; that must be so whenever he writes them out one after another
in their order.
THEAETETUS : Yes, clearly.
SOCRATES : And still without knowledge though with correct judgment — b
isn’t that our view?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : Yet possessing an account of it along with his correct judgment.
He was writing it, you see, with command of the way through its letters;
and we agreed that that is an account.
THEAETETUS : True.
SOCRATES : So here, my friend, we have correct judgment together with
an account, which we are not yet entitled to call knowledge.
THEAETETUS : Yes, I’m afraid that’s so.
SOCRATES : So it was only the poor man’s dream of gold that we had
when we thought we had got the truest account of knowledge. Or is it
early days to be harsh? Perhaps this is not the way in which one is to c
deﬁne ‘account’. We said that the man who deﬁnes knowledge as correct
judgment together with an account would choose one of three meanings
for‘account’. Perhaps the last is the one to deﬁne it by.
THEAETETUS : Yes, you’re right to remind me; there is one possibility still
left. The ﬁrst was, a kind of vocal image of thought; the one we have just
discussed was the way to the whole through the elements. Now what’s
your third suggestion?
SOCRATES : What the majority of people would say —namely, being able
to tell some mark by which the object you are asked about differs from
all other things.
THEAETETUS : Can you give me an example of such an ‘account’ of some-
thing?
SOCRATES : Well, take the sun, if you like. You would be satisﬁed, I d
imagine, with the answer that it is the brightest of the bodies that move
round the earth in the heavens.
THEAETETUS : Oh yes, quite.
SOCRATES : Now I want you to get hold of the principle that this illustrates.
It is what we were just saying —that if you get hold of the difference that
distinguishes a thing from everything else, then, so some people say, you
will have got an account of it. On the other hand, so long as it is some
common feature that you grasp, your account will be about all those things
which have this in common.232 Theaetetus
THEAETETUS : I see; I think it’s very good to call this kind of thing an ac- e
count.
SOCRATES : Then if a man with correct judgment about any one of the
things that are grasps in addition its difference from the rest, he has become
a knower of the thing he was a judger of before.
THEAETETUS : That’s our present position, anyway.
SOCRATES : Well, at this point, Theaetetus, as regards what we are saying,
I’m for all the world like a man looking at a shadow-painting;48when I’m
close up to it I can’t take it in in the least, though when I stood well back
from it, it appeared to me to have some meaning.
THEAETETUS : How’s that?
SOCRATES : I’ll see if I can explain. Suppose I have formed a correct 209
judgment about you; if I can grasp your account in addition, I know you,
but if not, I am merely judging you.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : And an account was to be a matter of expounding your differ-
entness?
THEAETETUS : That is so.
SOCRATES : Then when I was merely judging, my thought failed to grasp
any point of difference between you and the rest of mankind?
THEAETETUS : Apparently.
SOCRATES : What I had in mind, it seems, was some common characteris-
tic—something that belongs no more to you than to anybody else.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that must be so. b
SOCRATES : Then tell me, in Heaven’s name how, if that was so, did it
come about that you were the object of my judgment and nobody else?
Suppose my thought is that ‘This is Theaetetus—one who is a human
being, and has a nose and eyes and mouth’, and so on through the whole
list of limbs. Will this thought cause me to be thinking of Theaetetus rather
than of Theodorus, or of the proverbial ‘remotest Mysian’?
THEAETETUS : No, how could it?
SOCRATES : But suppose I think not merely of ‘the one with nose and
eyes’, but of ‘the one with a snub nose and prominent eyes’. Shall I even c
then be judging you any more than myself or anyone who is like that?
THEAETETUS : Not at all.
SOCRATES : It will not, I take it, be Theaetetus who is judged in my mind
until this snub-nosedness of yours has left imprinted and established in
me a record that is different in some way from the other snub-nosednesses
I have seen; and so with the other details of your makeup. And this
will remind me, if I meet you tomorrow, and make me judge correctly
about you.
48. The pictorial technique referred to ( skiagraphia) seems to have been one which de-
pended on contrasts between light and shade to create the appearance of form and
volume. A more familiar comparison for modern readers would be a pointilliste painting
by Seurat.Theaetetus 233
THEAETETUS : That’s perfectly true.
SOCRATES : Then correct judgment also must be concerned with the differ- d
entness of what it is about?
THEAETETUS : So it seems, anyway.
SOCRATES : Then what more might this ‘adding an account to correct
judgment’ be? If, on the one hand, it means that we must make another
judgment about the way in which a thing differs from the rest of things,
we are being required to do something very absurd.
THEAETETUS : How’s that?
SOCRATES : Because we already have a correct judgment about the way
a thing differs from other things; and we are then directed to add a correct
judgment about the way it differs from other things. At that rate, the way
a roller goes round or a pestle or anything else proverbial would be nothing e
compared with such directions; they might be more justly called a matter
of‘the blind leading the blind’. To tell us to add what we already have,
in order to come to know what we are judging about, bears a generous
resemblance to the behavior of a man benighted.
THEAETETUS : Whereas if, on the other hand, ...?49What else were you
going to suggest when you started this inquiry just now?
SOCRATES : Well, if ‘adding an account’ means that we are required to
get to know the differentness, not merely judge it, this most splendid of
our accounts of knowledge turns out to be a very amusing affair. For 210
getting to know of course is acquiring knowledge, isn ’t it?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
SOCRATES : So, it seems, the answer to the question ‘What is knowledge?’
will be ‘Correct judgment accompanied by knowledge of the differentness’—
for this is what we are asked to understand by the ‘addition of an account. ’
THEAETETUS : Apparently so.
SOCRATES : And it is surely just silly to tell us, when we are trying to
discover what knowledge is, that it is correct judgment accompanied by
knowledge, whether of differentness or of anything else? And so, Theaetetus,
knowledge is neither perception nor true judgment, nor an account added b
to true judgment.
THEAETETUS : It seems not.
SOCRATES : Well now, dear lad, are we still pregnant, still in labor with
any thoughts about knowledge? Or have we been delivered of them all?
THEAETETUS : As far as I’m concerned, Socrates, you’ve made me say far
more than ever was in me, Heaven knows.
SOCRATES : Well then, our art of midwifery tells us that all of these off-
spring are wind-eggs and not worth bringing up?
THEAETETUS : Undoubtedly.
SOCRATES : And so, Theaetetus, if ever in the future you should attempt
to conceive or should succeed in conceiving other theories, they will be c
better ones as the result of this inquiry. And if you remain barren, your
49. Reading Ei ge de ¯...forEipe de ¯at 209e5.234 Theaetetus
companions will ﬁnd you gentler and less tiresome; you will be modest
and not think you know what you don’t know. This is all my art can
achieve —nothing more. I do not know any of the things that other men
know —the great and inspired men of today and yesterday. But this art
of midwifery my mother and I had allotted to us by God; she to deliver
women, I to deliver men that are young and generous of spirit, all that 210d
have any beauty. And now I must go to the King’s Porch to meet the
indictment that Meletus has brought against me; but let us meet here again
in the morning, Theodorus.`;

export const sophist = `The day following their conversation in Theaetetus, the geometer Theodorus,
together with his Athenian pupils Theaetetus and Socrates’ young namesake, re-
joins Socrates for further discussion. They bring with them a philosopher visit-
ing from Elea, a Greek town of Southern Italy famous as home to the great phi-
losopher Parmenides and his pupil, the logician Zeno—both of whom Socrates
had encountered in yet another dialogue closely linked to this one, Parmen-
ides. Socrates asks whether this visitor and the others at Elea treat the philoso-
pher, the statesman, and the sophist as actually being just one thing—a single
sort of person, though appearing to different people as falling under just one or
another of these headings—or rather as having three distinct intellectual capaci-
ties, as their three names indicate. Hearing that the latter is the Eleatics’ view,
he thus initiates two successive, complex discussions. First, in Sophist, the visi-
tor, opting to use Socrates’ favorite procedure of question and answer, displays
in full detail his own conception of the sophist. In Statesman he then contin-
ues in a similar way with the statesman. There is no third discussion of the
philosopher, despite occasional suggestions that the initial agenda calls for one.
The visitor, after all, isa distinguished philosopher. Perhaps Plato’s intention
is to mark the philosopher off for us from these other two through showing a
supreme philosopher at work deﬁning them and therein demonstrating his own
devotion to truth, and the correct method of analysis for achieving it: for Plato
these together deﬁne the philosopher.
In deﬁning the sophist, the visitor employs the ‘method of division’—or,
more accurately, of ‘collection and division’—described in Phaedrus 265d ff.
and early on in Philebus; this also underlies the latter’s discussion of the varie-
ties of pleasure and knowledge. He ﬁrst offers six distinct routes for under-
standing the sophist, by systematically demarcating speciﬁc classes within suc-
cessively smaller, nested, more inclusive classes of practitioners; these speciﬁc
subclasses are then identiﬁed as the sophists. Apparently ‘sophistry’ is a some-
what loosely associated set of distinct capacities—it hunts rich, prominent
young men so as to receive a wage for speaking persuasively to them about vir-
tue, it sells (in several different circumstances) items of alleged knowledge on
this same subject, it is expert at winning private debates about right and
wrong, it cleanses people’s souls by refuting their false or poorly supported
ideas. Yet in a ﬁnal accounting—whose long-delayed completion is reached
only at the very end of the dialogue—the sophist is ‘penned in’ as one who,
235236 Sophist
though aware that he does not know anything, produces in words totally inade-
quate ‘copies’ of the truth on important subjects, ones he makes appear to oth-
ers to bethe truth, even though, being false, they are hardly even like it. The
relation of this ﬁnal deﬁnition to the six ﬁrst ones is not fully explored. The vis-
itor may be intimating the general principle that sometimes a ‘nature’ or real
‘kind’ has no single place in a systematic division; it uniﬁes a set of differently
located functions, each with its own differences from its more immediate intel-
lectual neighbors. In any case, the essential idea of the ‘method of collection
and division’ is that each thing is to be understood through a full, lively aware-
ness of its similarities and differences in relation to other things —the sort of
awareness that the varied divisions encourage us to reach. Much other general
instruction on how to make proper use of the ‘method’ is given in Statesman.
The visitor delays completing his ﬁnal accounting because he sees the need
ﬁrst to show how it is even possible for anyone to do what he wants to say the
sophist does do —speak words that appear to be true but in fact are false. The
trouble is that he understands speaking falsely as saying ‘what is not’, while
his teacher Parmenides famously maintained that that is impossible: so he is re-
quired to engage in ‘parricide’—in showing how Parmenides was wrong. There
ensues an elaborate discussion of the meaning of ‘what is’ as well as of ‘what
is not’, in which we can see Plato working out a new theory of the nature of
the Form of being, and its relations to other ‘greatest’ or most comprehensive
Forms: such a theory is needed to make saying ‘what is not’—speaking
falsely —intelligible after all. Much of the interest of the dialogue has always
been found in this metaphysical excursion into the topic of being —and not be-
ing—in general.J.M.C.
THEODORUS : We’ve come at the proper time by yesterday’s agreement, 216
Socrates. We’re also bringing this man who’s visiting us. He’s from Elea
and he’s a member of the group who gather around Parmenides and Zeno.
And he’s very much a philosopher.
SOCRATES : Are you bringing a visitor, Theodorus? Or are you bringing
a god without realizing it instead, like the ones Homer mentions? He says
gods accompany people who are respectful and just.1He also says the god b
of visitors—who’s at least as much a god as any other—is a companion
who keeps an eye on people’s actions, both the criminal and the lawful
ones. So your visitor might be a greater power following along with you,
Translated by Nicholas P. White.
1. See Odyssey ix.270–71.Sophist 237
a sort of god of refutation to keep watch on us and show how bad we are
at speaking —and to refute us.
THEODORUS : That’s not our visitor’s style, Socrates. He’s more moderate
than the enthusiasts for debating are. And he doesn’t seem to me to be a
god at all. He isdivine —but then I call all philosophers that. c
SOCRATES : And that’s the right thing for you to do, my friend. But proba-
bly it’s no easier, I imagine, to distinguish that kind of person than it is
to distinguish gods. Certainly the genuine philosophers who “haunt our
cities”2—by contrast to the fake ones —take on all sorts of different appear-
ances just because of other people’s ignorance. As philosophers look down
from above at the lives of those below them, some people think they’re
worthless and others think they’re worth everything in the world. Some-
times they take on the appearance of statesmen, and sometimes of sophists. d
Sometimes, too, they might give the impression that they’re completely
insane. But if it’s all right with our visitor I’d be glad to have him tell us
what the people where he comes from used to apply the following names
to, and what they thought about these things? 217
THEODORUS : What things?
SOCRATES :Sophist, statesman, and philosopher.
THEODORUS : What, or what kind of thing, especially makes you consider
asking that question? What special problem about them do you have
in mind?
SOCRATES : This: did they think that sophists, statesmen, and philosophers
make up one kind of thing or two? Or did they divide them up into three
kinds corresponding to the three names and attach one name to each of them?
THEODORUS : I don’t think it would offend him to tell us about it. Or
would it, sir?
VISITOR : No, Theodorus, it wouldn’t offend me. I don’t have any objection. b
And the answer is easy: they think there are three kinds. Distinguishing
clearly what each of them is, though, isn’t a small or easy job.
THEODORUS : Luckily, Socrates, you’ve gotten hold of words that are very
much like the ones we happened to be asking him about. And he made
the same excuse to us that he made to you just now —since he’s heard a
lot about the issue, after all, and hasn’t forgotten it.
SOCRATES : In that case, sir, don’t refuse our very ﬁrst request. Tell us c
this. When you want to explain something to somebody, do you usually
prefer to explain it by yourself in a long speech, or to do it with questions?
That’s the way Parmenides did it one time, when he was very old and I
was young.3He used questions to generate a very ﬁne discussion.
2. See Odyssey xvii.483–87. . . . gods go from town to town disguised as visitors of
varied appearance, just like Odysseus on this occasion, to observe the deeds of just and
unjust people.
3. The reference is to the conversation in the Parmenides.238 Sophist
VISITOR :I t’s easier to do it the second way, Socrates, if you’re talking d
with someone who’s easy to handle and isn’t a trouble-maker. Otherwise
it’s easier to do it alone.
SOCRATES : You can pick anyone here you want. They’ll all answer you
politely. But if you take my advice you’ll choose one of the young ones —
Theaetetus here or for that matter any of the others you prefer.
VISITOR : As long as I’m here with you for the ﬁrst time, Socrates, I’db e
embarrassed not to make our meeting a conversational give-and-take, but e
instead to stretch things out and give a long continuous speech by myself
or even to someone else, as if I were delivering an oration. A person
wouldn’t expect the issue you just mentioned to be as small as your
question suggests. In fact it needs a very long discussion. On the other
hand, it certainly seems rude and uncivilized for a visitor not to oblige
you and these people here, especially when you’ve spoken the way you
have. So I’ll accept Theaetetus as the person to talk with, on the basis of 218
your urging, and because I’ve talked with him myself before.
THEAETETUS : Then please do that, sir, and you’ll be doing us all a favor,
just as Socrates said.
VISITOR : We probably don’t need to say anything more about that, then,
Theaetetus. From now on you’re the one I should have the rest of our talk
with. But if you’re annoyed at how long the job takes, you should blame
your friends here instead of me.
THEAETETUS : I don’t think I’ll give out now, but if anything like that does b
happen we’ll have to use this other Socrates over here as a substitute. He’s
Socrates’ namesake, but he’s my age and exercises with me and he’s used
to sharing lots of tasks with me.
VISITOR : Good. As the talk goes along you’ll think about that on your
own. But with me I think you need to begin the investigation from the
sophist —by searching for him and giving a clear account of what he is. c
Now in this case you and I only have the name in common, and maybe
we’ve each used it for a different thing. In every case, though, we always
need to be in agreement about the thing itself by means of a verbal explana-
tion, rather than doing without any such explanation and merely agreeing
about the name. But it isn’t the easiest thing in the world to grasp the
tribe we’re planning to search for —I mean, the sophist —or say what it is.
But if an important issue needs to be worked out well, then as everyone
has long thought, you need to practice on unimportant, easier issues ﬁrst. d
So that’s my advice to us now, Theaetetus: since we think it’s hard to hunt
down and deal with the kind, sophist, we ought to practice our method of
hunting on something easier ﬁrst—unless you can tell us about another
way that’s somehow more promising.
THEAETETUS : I can’t.
VISITOR : Do you want us to focus on something trivial and try to use it
as a model for the more important issue?Sophist 239
THEAETETUS : Yes. e
VISITOR : What might we propose that’s unimportant and easy to under-
stand, but can have an account given of it just as much as more important
things can? For example, an angler: isn’t that recognizable to everybody,
but not worth being too serious about?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : That, I expect, will provide an appropriate method of hunting 219
and way of talking for what we want.
THEAETETUS : That would be ﬁne.
VISITOR : Well then, let’s go after the angler from this starting point. Tell
me, shall we take him to be an expert at something, or a nonexpert with
another sort of capacity?
THEAETETUS :H e ’sd e ﬁnitely not a nonexpert.
VISITOR : But expertise as a whole falls pretty much into two types.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : There’s farming, or any sort of caring for any mortal body; and
there’s also caring for things that are put together or fabricated, which we
call equipment; and there’s imitation. The right thing would be to call all b
those things by a single name.
THEAETETUS : How? What name?
VISITOR : When you bring anything into being that wasn’t in being before,
we say you’re a producer and that the thing you’ve brought into being
is produced.
THEAETETUS : That’s right.
VISITOR : And all the things we went through just now have their own
capacity for that.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Let’s put them under the heading of production.
THEAETETUS : All right. c
VISITOR : Next, consider the whole type that has to do with learning,
recognition, commerce, combat, and hunting. None of these creates any-
thing. They take things that are or have come into being, and they take
possession of some of them with words and actions, and they keep other
things from being taken possession of. For that reason it would be appro-
priate to call all the parts of this type acquisition.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that would be appropriate.
VISITOR : If every expertise falls under acquisition or production, Theaete- d
tus, which one shall we put angling in?
THEAETETUS : Acquisition, obviously.
VISITOR : Aren’t there two types of expertise in acquisition? Is one type
mutually willing exchange, through gifts and wages and purchase? And
would the other type, which brings things into one’s possession by actions
or words, be expertise in taking possession?
THEAETETUS : It seems so, anyway, given what we’ve said.240 Sophist
VISITOR : Well then, shouldn’t we cut possession-taking in two?
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : The part that’s done openly we label combat, and the part that’s e
secret we call hunting.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And furthermore it would be unreasonable not to cut hunting
in two.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : We divide it into the hunting of living things and the hunting
of lifeless things.
THEAETETUS : Yes, if there are both kinds.
VISITOR : How could there not be? But we should let the part involving 220
lifeless things go. It doesn’t have a name, except for some kinds of diving
and other trivial things like that. The other part —namely the hunting of
living animals —we should call animal-hunting.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : And isn’t it right to say that animal-hunting has two types? One
is land-hunting, the hunting of things with feet, which is divided into
many types with many names. The other is aquatic hunting, which hunts
animals that swim.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And things that swim, we see, fall into things with wings and b
things living underwater.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And all hunting of things that have wings, I suppose, is called
bird-catching.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And all hunting of underwater things is ﬁshing.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Well then, this kind of hunting might be divided into two
main parts.
THEAETETUS : What are they?
VISITOR : One of them does its hunting with stationary nets and the other
one does it by striking.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean? How are you dividing them?
VISITOR : The ﬁrst one is whatever involves surrounding something c
and enclosing it to prevent it from escaping, so it’s reasonable to call
it enclosure.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Shouldn’t baskets, nets, slipknots, creels, and so forth be
called enclosures?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR :S ow e ’ll call this part of hunting enclosure-hunting or something
like that.Sophist 241
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : But the kind that’s done by striking with hooks or three-pronged
spears is different, and we should call it by one word, strike-hunting. Or d
what term would be better?
THEAETETUS : Let’s not worry about the name. That one will do.
VISITOR : Then there’s a part of striking that’s done at night by
ﬁrelight, and as it happens is called torch-hunting by the people who
do it.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But the whole daytime part is called hooking, since even the
three-pronged spears have hooks on their points.
THEAETETUS : Yes, that’s what it’s called. e
VISITOR : Then one part of the hooking part of striking is done by striking
downward from above. And since you usually use a three-pronged spear
that way, I think it’s called spearing.
THEAETETUS : Some people do call it that.
VISITOR : And I suppose there’s only one type left.
THEAETETUS : What?
VISITOR :I t’s the type of striking contrary to the previous one. It’s done
with a hook, not to just any part of the ﬁsh’s body but always to the prey’s 221
head and mouth, and pulls it upward from below with rods or reeds.
What are we going to say its name should be, Theaetetus?
THEAETETUS : I think we’ve now found what we said we aimed to ﬁnd.
VISITOR : So now we’re in agreement about the angler’s expertise, not b
just as to its name; in addition we’ve also sufﬁciently grasped a verbal
explanation concerning the thing itself. Within expertise as a whole one
half was acquisitive; half of the acquisitive was taking possession; half of
possession-taking was hunting; half of hunting was animal-hunting; half
of animal-hunting was aquatic hunting; all of the lower portion of aquatic
hunting was ﬁshing; half of ﬁshing was hunting by striking; and half of
striking was hooking. And the part of hooking that involves a blow drawing
a thing upward from underneath is called by a name that’s derived by its c
similarity to the action itself, that is, it’s called draw-ﬁshing or angling —
which is what we’re searching for.
THEAETETUS :W e ’ve got a completely adequate demonstration of that,
anyway.
VISITOR : Well then, let’s use that model to try and ﬁnd the sophist, and
see what he is.
THEAETETUS : Fine.
VISITOR : The ﬁrst question, then, was whether we should suppose the
angler is a nonexpert, or that he’s an expert at something?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Well, shall we suppose the sophist is a layman, or completely d
and truly an expert?242 Sophist
THEAETETUS :H e’s not a layman at all. I understand what you’re saying:
he has to be the kind of person that the name sophist indicates.4
VISITOR : So it seems we need to take him to have a kind of expertise.
THEAETETUS : But what is it?
VISITOR : For heaven’s sake, don’t we recognize that the one man belongs
to the same kind as the other?
THEAETETUS : Which men?
VISITOR : The angler and the sophist.
THEAETETUS : In what way?
VISITOR : To me they both clearly appear to be hunters.
THEAETETUS : We said which kind of hunting the angler does. What kind e
does the sophist do?
VISITOR : We divided all hunting into two parts, one for land animals
and one for swimming animals.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : We went through one part, about the animals that swim under-
water. But we left the land part undivided, though we noted that it contains
many types.
THEAETETUS : Of course. 222
VISITOR : Up till that point the sophist and the angler go the same way,
beginning from expertise in acquisition.
THEAETETUS : They seem to, anyway.
VISITOR : Starting from animal hunting, though, they turn away from
each other. One goes to ponds, rivers, and the sea, and hunts for the
animals there.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : The other one goes to the land and to different kinds of rivers,
which are like plentiful meadows of wealthy youths, to take possession
of the things living there.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean? b
VISITOR : There are two main kinds of things to hunt on land.
THEAETETUS : What are they?
VISITOR : Tame things and wild ones.
THEAETETUS : Is there any such thing as hunting tame animals?
VISITOR : There is if human beings are tame animals, at any rate. Make
whichever assumption you like: either there are no tame animals, or there
are tame animals but humans are wild, or else, you’ll say, humans are
tame but aren’t hunted. Specify whichever you prefer to say.
THEAETETUS : I think we’re tame animals and I’ll say that humans are in c
fact hunted.
4. The word “sophist” (sophiste ¯s) is etymologically related to the word “wise” (sophos),
and so can be taken to connote knowledge and expertise.Sophist 243
VISITOR : Then let’s say that the hunting of tame animals falls into two
parts.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : Let’s take piracy, enslavement, tyranny, along with everything
that has to do with war, and let’sd e ﬁne them all together as hunting
by force.
THEAETETUS : Fine.
VISITOR : And we’ll also take legal oratory, political oratory, and conversa-
tion all together in one whole, and call them all one single sort of expertise, d
expertise in persuasion.
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : Let’s say that there are two kinds of persuasion.
THEAETETUS : What are they?
VISITOR : One is done privately, and the other is done in public.
THEAETETUS : Yes, each of those is one type.
VISITOR : And doesn’t one part of private hunting earn wages, while the
other part gives gifts?
THEAETETUS : I don’t understand.
VISITOR : It seems you aren’t paying attention to the way lovers hunt.
THEAETETUS : In what connection?
VISITOR : The fact that when they hunt people they give presents to e
them too.
THEAETETUS : Very true.
VISITOR : Let’s call this type expertise in love.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : One part of the wage-earning type approaches people by being
agreeable, uses only pleasure as its bait, and earns only its own room and
board. I think we’d all call it ﬂattery, or expertise in pleasing people. 223
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But doesn’t the kind of wage-earning that actually earns money,
though it claims to deal with people for the sake of virtue, deserve to be
called by a different name?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : What name? Try and tell me.
THEAETETUS :I t’s obvious. I think we’ve found the sophist. I think that’s
the name that would be suitable for him.
VISITOR : So according to our account now, Theaetetus, it seems that this b
sort of expertise belongs to appropriation, taking possession, hunting,
animal-hunting, hunting on land, human hunting, hunting by persuasion,
hunting privately, and money-earning.5It’s the hunting of rich, prominent
young men. And according to the way our account has turned out, it’s
what should be called the expertise of the sophist.
5. In addition to the words bracketed by Burnet, we bracket doxopaideutike ¯salso.244 Sophist
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : Still, let’s look at it this way too, since what we’re looking for c
isn’t a trivial sort of expertise but quite a diverse one. And even in what
we’ve just said earlier it actually presents the appearance of being not
what we’re now saying, but a different type.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : Expertise in acquisition had two parts, hunting and exchanging.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And let’s say there are two types of exchanging, giving and
selling.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : And we’re also going to say that selling divides in two.
THEAETETUS : How? d
VISITOR : One part is the sale of things that the seller himself makes. The
other is purveying, that is, the purveying of things other people make.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Then what? Isn’t the part of purveying that’s done within the
city—about half of it —called retailing?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And isn’t wholesaling the part that buys and sells things for
exchange between one city and another?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And can’t we see that one part of wholesaling sells things for e
the nourishment and use of the body in exchange for cash, and the other
sells things for the soul?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean by that?
VISITOR : Maybe we don’t understand the one for the soul —since certainly
we understand the other kind.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Let’s consider every kind of music that’s carried from one city 224
to another and bought here and sold there, as well as painting and shows
and other things for the soul. Some of them are transported and sold for
amusement and others for serious purposes. We can use the word wholesaler
for the transporter and seller of these things just as well as for someone
who sells food and beverages.
THEAETETUS : That’s absolutely true.
VISITOR : Wouldn’t you use the same name for somebody who bought b
and exchanged items of knowledge for money from city to city?
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.
VISITOR : Wouldn’t the right thing to say be that the art of display is one
part of that soul-wholesaling? And don’t we have to call the other part of
it, the part that consists in selling knowledge, by a name that’s similar and
also equally ridiculous?
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.VISITOR: And one name should be used for the part of this knowledge-  
selling that deals with knowledge of virtue, and another name for the part  
that deals with knowledge of other things?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR: “Expertise-selling” would fit the second one. You try and tell  
me the name of the first one.
THEAETETUS : What other name could you mention that would fit, except  
for the kind, sophist, which we’re looking for right now?
VISITOR: I couldn’t mention any other one. Come on now and let’s collect it  
all together. We’ll say that the expertise of the part of acquisition, exchange,  
selling, wholesaling, and soul-wholesaling, dealing in words and learning  
that have to do with virtue—that’s sophistry in its second appearance.
THEAETETUS : Definitely.
VISITOR: In the third place I think you’d call somebody just the same  
thing if he settled here in the city and undertook to make his living selling  
those same things, both ones that he’d bought and ones that he’d made  
himself.
THEAETETUS : Yes, I would.
VISITOR: So apparently you’ll still say that sophistry falls under acquisi -
tion, exchange, and selling, either by retailing things that others make or by 
selling things that he makes himself. It’s the retail sale of any learning that 
has to do with the sorts of things we mentioned.
THEAETETUS : It has to be, since we need to stay consistent with what we 
said before.
VISITOR: Now let’s see whether the type we’re chasing is something like 
the following.
THEAETETUS : What? 
VISITOR: Combat was one part of acquisition.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR: And it makes sense to divide it in two.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR: We’ll take one part to be competition and the other part to be  
fighting.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR: And it would be fitting and proper to give a name like violence to  
the part of fighting in which one body fights against another.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR: And as for the part that pits words against words, what else 
would you call it other than controversy?
THEAETETUS : Nothing else.
VISITOR: But we have to have two types of controversy.T HEAETETUS : In 
what way?
VISITOR: So far as it involves one long public speech directed against  
another and deals with justice and injustice, it’s forensic.
THEAETETUS : Yes.Sophist  245
c
d
e
225
bVISITOR: But if it goes on in private discussions and is chopped up into  
questions and answers, don’t we usually call it disputation?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR: One part of disputation involves controversy about contracts  
and isn’t carried on in any systematic or expert way. We should take that  
to be a type of disputation, since we can express what makes it different.  
But it hasn’t been given a name before and it doesn’t deserve to get one 
from us.
THEAETETUS : That’s true. Its subtypes are too small and varied.
VISITOR: But what about disputation that’s done expertly and involves  
controversy about general issues, including what’s just and what’s unjust? 
Don’t we normally call that debating?6
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR: Part of debating, it turns out, wastes money and the other  
part makes money.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR: Let’s try and say what each of them ought to be called.
THEAETETUS : We have to.
VISITOR: I think one type of debating is a result of the pleasure a person  
gets from the activity, and involves neglecting his own livelihood. But its  
style is unpleasant to most people who hear it, and in my view it’s right to  
call it chatter.
THEAETETUS : That’s pretty much what people do call it.
VISITOR: You take a turn now. Say what its contrary is, which makes  
money from debates between individuals.
THEAETETUS : How could anyone go wrong in saying that the amazing  
sophist we’ve been after has turned up once again for the fourth time.
VISITOR: It seems his type is precisely the money-making branch of ex -
pertise in debating, disputation, controversy, fighting, combat, and acquisi-
tion. According to what our account shows us now, that’s the sophist.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR: So you see how true it is that the beast is complex and can’t be 
caught with one hand, as they say.
THEAETETUS : It does take both hands.
VISITOR: Yes, and you need all your capacity to follow his tracks in what’s 
to come. Tell me: don’t we call some things by names that houseservants 
use?
THEAETETUS : A lot of things. But what are you asking about?
VISITOR: For example things like filtering, straining, winnowing.
6. The word here translated by “debating,” eristikon, is sometimes translated (or trans-
literated) “eristic.” It refers to a practice of competitive debating which the sophists made 
popular in Athens. Plato’s use of the term stigmatizes the practice as not directed at truth.246 Sophist

bSophist 247
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And also we know about carding, spinning, weaving, and a
million other things like that which are involved in experts’ crafts. Is
that right?
THEAETETUS : What general point are you trying to make with these ex- c
amples?
VISITOR : All the things I’ve mentioned are kinds of dividing.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Since there’s a single kind of expertise involved in all of them,
then according to what I’ve said we’ll expect it to have a single name.
THEAETETUS : What shall we call it?
VISITOR : Discrimination.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : Think about whether we can see two types in it.
THEAETETUS : You’re asking me to do some quick thinking.
VISITOR : In fact in what we’ve called discriminations one kind separates d
what’s worse from what’s better and the other separates like from like.
THEAETETUS : That’s obvious —now that you’ve said it.
VISITOR : I don’t have an ordinary name for one of them, but I do have
a name for the kind of discrimination that leaves what’s better and throws
away what’s worse.
THEAETETUS : What? Tell me.
VISITOR : I think everyone says that that kind of discrimination is
cleansing.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Won’t everyone see that cleansing has two types? e
THEAETETUS : Yes, maybe, if they had time, but I don’t see now.
VISITOR : Many kinds of cleansing that have to do with the body can
appropriately be included under a simple name.
THEAETETUS : Which ones? What name?
VISITOR : There’s the cleansing of the inside part of living bodies, which
is done by gymnastics and medicine. And there’s the cleansing of the 227
insigniﬁcant outside part that’s done by bathing. And also there’s the
cleansing of nonliving bodies, which fulling and all kinds of furbishing take
care of and which have lots of specialized and ridiculous-seeming names.
THEAETETUS : Very ridiculous.
VISITOR : Of course, Theaetetus. But our method of dealing with words
doesn’t care one way or the other whether cleansing by sponging or by
taking medicine does a lot of good or only a little. The method aims at
acquiring intelligence, so it tries to understand how all kinds of expertise b
belong to the same kind or not. And so for that it values them all equally
without thinking that some of them are more ridiculous than others, as
far as their similarity is concerned. And it doesn’t consider a person more
impressive because he exempliﬁes hunting by military expertise rather248 Sophist
than by picking lice. Instead it usually considers him more vapid. Moreover
you just asked about what name we call all the capacities that are assigned
to living or nonliving bodies. As far as that’s concerned, it doesn’t matter c
to our method which name would seem to be the most appropriate, just
so long as it keeps the cleansing of the soul separate from the cleansing
of everything else. For the time being, the method has only tried to distin-
guish the cleansing that concerns thinking from the other kinds —if, that
is, we understand what its aim is.
THEAETETUS : I do understand, and I agree that there are two types of
cleansing, one dealing with the soul and a separate one dealing with
the body.
VISITOR : Fine. Next listen and try to cut the one we’ve mentioned in two.
THEAETETUS :I’ll try to follow your lead and cut it however you say. d
VISITOR : Do we say that wickedness in the soul is something different
from virtue?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And to cleanse something was to leave what’s good and throw
out whatever’s inferior.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So insofar as we can ﬁnd some way to remove what’s bad in
the soul, it will be suitable to call it cleansing.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : We have to say that there are two kinds of badness that affect
the soul.
THEAETETUS : What are they?
VISITOR : One is like bodily sickness, and the other is like ugliness. 228
THEAETETUS : I don’t understand.
VISITOR : Presumably you regard sickness and discord as the same thing,
don’t you?
THEAETETUS : I don’t know what I should say to that.
VISITOR : Do you think that discord is just dissension among things that
are naturally of the same kind, and arises out of some kind of corruption?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And ugliness is precisely a consistently unattractive sort of
disproportion?
THEAETETUS : Yes. b
VISITOR : Well then, don’t we see that there’s dissension in the souls of
people in poor condition, between beliefs and desires, anger and pleasures,
reason and pains, and all of those things with each other?
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : But all of them do have to be akin to each other.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR :S ow e ’d be right if we said that wickedness is discord and
sickness of the soul.Sophist 249
THEAETETUS : Absolutely right.
VISITOR : Well then, suppose something that’s in motion aims at a target c
and tries to hit it, but on every try passes by it and misses. Are we going
to say that it does this because it’s properly proportioned or because it’s
out of proportion?
THEAETETUS : Out of proportion, obviously.
VISITOR : But we know that no soul is willingly ignorant of anything.
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.
VISITOR : But ignorance occurs precisely when a soul tries for the truth, d
but swerves aside from understanding and so is beside itself.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : So we have to take it that an ignorant soul is ugly and out
of proportion.
THEAETETUS : It seems so.
VISITOR : Then there are, it appears, these two kinds of badness in the
soul. Most people call one of them wickedness, but it’s obviously a disease
of the soul.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : They call the other one ignorance, but if it occurs only in a
person’s soul they aren’t willing to agree that it’s a form of badness.
THEAETETUS : One thing absolutely must be granted —the point I was in e
doubt about when you made it just now —that there are two kinds of
deﬁciency in the soul. We need to say that cowardice, licentiousness, and
injustice are a disease in us, and that to be extremely ignorant of all sorts
of things is a kind of ugliness.
VISITOR : In the case of the body, weren’t there two kinds of expertise
dealing with those two conditions?
THEAETETUS : What were they?
VISITOR : Gymnastics for ugliness and medicine for sickness. 229
THEAETETUS : Apparently.
VISITOR : And isn’t correction the most appropriate of all kinds of expertise
for treating insolence, injustice, and cowardice?7
THEAETETUS : So it seems, to judge by what people think.
VISITOR : Well then, for all kinds of ignorance wouldn’t teaching be the
right treatment to mention?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Now should we say that there’s only one kind of expertise in b
teaching or more than one, with two of them being the most important
ones? Think about it.
THEAETETUS : I am.
VISITOR : I think we’ll ﬁnd it quickest this way.
THEAETETUS : How?
7. The text seems faulty here. The general sense, however, is clear.250 Sophist
VISITOR : By seeing whether ignorance has a cut down the middle of it.
If it has two parts, that will force teaching to have two parts too, one for
each of the parts of ignorance.
THEAETETUS : Well, do you see what we’re looking for?
VISITOR : I think I see a large, difﬁcult type of ignorance marked off from c
the others and overshadowing all of them.
THEAETETUS : What’s it like?
VISITOR : Not knowing, but thinking that you know. That’s what probably
causes all the mistakes we make when we think.
THEAETETUS : That’s true.
VISITOR : And furthermore it’s the only kind of ignorance that’s called
lack of learning.
THEAETETUS : Certainly.
VISITOR : Well then, what should we call the part of teaching that gets
rid of it?
THEAETETUS : The other part consists in the teaching of crafts, I think, but d
here in Athens we call this one education.
VISITOR : And just about all other Greeks do too, Theaetetus. But we still
have to think about whether education is indivisible or has divisions that
are worth mentioning.
THEAETETUS : We do have to think about that.
VISITOR : I think it can be cut somehow.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : One part of the kind of teaching that’s done in words is a rough e
road, and the other part is smoother.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean by these two parts?
VISITOR : One of them is our forefathers’ time-honored method of scolding
or gently encouraging. They used to employ it especially on their sons,
and many still use it on them nowadays when they do something wrong. 230
Admonition would be the right thing to call all of this.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : As for the other part, some people seem to have an argument
to give to themselves that lack of learning is always involuntary, and that
if someone thinks he’s wise, he’ll never be willing to learn anything about
what he thinks he’s clever at. These people think that though admonition
is a lot of work, it doesn’t do much good.
THEAETETUS : They’re right about that.
VISITOR : So they set out to get rid of the belief in one’s own wisdom in b
another way.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : They cross-examine someone when he thinks he’s saying some-
thing though he’s saying nothing. Then, since his opinions will vary incon-
sistently, these people will easily scrutinize them. They collect his opinions
together during the discussion, put them side by side, and show that theySophist 251
conﬂict with each other at the same time on the same subjects in relation
to the same things and in the same respects. The people who are being
examined see this, get angry at themselves, and become calmer toward
others. They lose their inﬂated and rigid beliefs about themselves that c
way, and no loss is pleasanter to hear or has a more lasting effect on them.
Doctors who work on the body think it can’t beneﬁt from any food that’s
offered to it until what’s interfering with it from inside is removed. The
people who cleanse the soul, my young friend, likewise think the soul,
too, won’t get any advantage from any learning that’s offered to it until d
someone shames it by refuting it, removes the opinions that interfere with
learning, and exhibits it cleansed, believing that it knows only those things
that it does know, and nothing more.
THEAETETUS : That’s the best and most healthy-minded way to be.
VISITOR : For all these reasons, Theaetetus, we have to say that refutation
is the principal and most important kind of cleansing. Conversely we have
to think that even the king of Persia, if he remains unrefuted, is uncleansed e
in the most important respect. He’s also uneducated and ugly, in just the
ways that anyone who is going to be really happy has to be completely
clean and beautiful.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : Well then, who are we going to say the people who apply this
form of expertise are? I’m afraid to call them sophists. 231
THEAETETUS : Why?
VISITOR :S ow ed o n ’t pay sophists too high an honor.
THEAETETUS : But there’s a similarity between a sophist and what we’ve
been talking about.
VISITOR : And between a wolf and a dog, the wildest thing there is and
the gentlest. If you’re going to be safe, you have to be especially careful
about similarities, since the type we’re talking about is very slippery.
Anyway, let that description of them stand. I certainly don’t think that
when the sophists are enough on their guard the dispute will be about an
unimportant distinction. b
THEAETETUS : That seems right.
VISITOR : So let it be the cleansing part of the expertise of discriminating
things; and let it be marked off as the part of that which concerns souls;
and within that it’s teaching; and within teaching it’s education. And let’s
say that within education, according to the way the discussion has turned
now, the refutation of the empty belief in one’s own wisdom is nothing
other than our noble sophistry.
THEAETETUS : Let’s say that. But the sophist has appeared in lots of differ-
ent ways. So I’m confused about what expression or assertion could convey c
the truth about what he really is.
VISITOR : You’re right to be confused. But we have to think that he’s
extremely confused, too, about where he can go to escape from our account252 Sophist
of him. The saying that you can’t escape all your pursuers is right. So now
we really have to go after him.
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : But let’s stop ﬁrst and catch our breath, so to speak. And while
we’re resting let’s ask ourselves, “Now, how many different appearances d
has the sophist presented to us?” I think we ﬁrst discovered him as a hired
hunter of rich young men.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Second, as a wholesaler of learning about the soul.
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : Third, didn’t he appear as a retailer of the same things?
THEAETETUS : Yes, and fourth as a seller of his own learning?
VISITOR : Your memory’s correct. I’ll try to recall the ﬁfth way: he was
an athlete in verbal combat, distinguished by his expertise in debating. e
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : The sixth appearance was disputed, but still we made a conces-
sion to him and took it that he cleanses the soul of beliefs that interfere
with learning.
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.
VISITOR : Well then, suppose people apply the name of a single sort of 232
expertise to someone, but he appears to have expert knowledge of lots of
things. In a case like that don’t you notice that something’s wrong with
the way he appears? Isn’t it obvious that if somebody takes him to be an
expert at many things, then that observer can’t be seeing clearly what it
is in his expertise that all of those many pieces of learning focus on —
which is why he calls him by many names instead of one?
THEAETETUS : That deﬁnitely does seem to be the nature of the case.
VISITOR :S ol e t ’s not let laziness make that happen to us. First let’s take b
up one of the things we said about the sophist before, which seemed to
me to exhibit him especially clearly.
THEAETETUS : What is it?
VISITOR : We said that he engages in disputes, didn’t we?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And also that he teaches other people to do the same thing
too?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Then let’s think: what subject do people like him claim to make
others able to engage in disputes about? Let’s start with something like
this: do sophists make people competent to dispute about issues about the c
gods, which are opaque to most people?
THEAETETUS : Well, people say they do.
VISITOR : And also things that are open to view, on the earth and in the
sky, and related matters?
THEAETETUS : Of course.Sophist 253
VISITOR : And when people make general statements in private discus-
sions about being and coming-to-be, we know that sophists are clever
at contradicting them and they also make other people able to do the
same thing?
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : And what about laws and all kinds of political issues? Don’t d
sophists promise to make people capable of engaging in controversies
about them?
THEAETETUS : If they didn’t promise that, practically no one would bother
to discuss anything with them.
VISITOR : As a matter of fact you can ﬁnd anything you need to say to
contradict any expert himself, both in general and within each particular
ﬁeld, laid out published and written down for anybody who wants to
learn it.
THEAETETUS : Apparently you’re talking about Protagoras’ writings on
wrestling and other ﬁelds of expertise. e
VISITOR : And on many other things, too, my friend. In fact, take expertise
in disputation as a whole. Doesn’t it seem like a capacity that’s sufﬁcient
for carrying on controversies about absolutely everything?
THEAETETUS : It doesn’t seem to leave much of anything out, anyway.
VISITOR : But for heaven’s sake, my boy, do you think that’s possible? Or
maybe you young people see into this issue more keenly than we do.
THEAETETUS : Into what? What are you getting at? I don’t fully understand 233
what you’re asking.
VISITOR : Whether it’s possible for any human being to know everything.
THEAETETUS : If it were, sir, we’d be very well off.
VISITOR : But how could someone who didn’t know about a subject make
a sound objection against someone who knew about it?
THEAETETUS : He couldn’t.
VISITOR : Then what is it in the sophist’s capacity that’s so amazing?
THEAETETUS : About what?
VISITOR : How the sophists can ever make young people believe they’re b
wiser than everyone else about everything. It’s obvious that they didn’t
make correct objections against anyone, or didn’t appear so to young
people. Or if they did appear to make correct objections, but their controver-
sies didn’t make them look any the wiser for it, then —just as you say —
people would hardly be willing to pay them money to become their stu-
dents.
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : But people are willing to?
THEAETETUS : They certainly are.
VISITOR : Since sophists do seem, I think, to know about the things they c
dispute about.
THEAETETUS : Of course.254 Sophist
VISITOR : And they do it, we say, about every subject?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So to their students they appear wise about everything?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But without actually being wise —since that appeared impos-
sible.
THEAETETUS : Of course it’s impossible.
VISITOR : So the sophist has now appeared as having a kind of belief-
knowledge about everything, but not truth.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely. What you’ve said about them is probably just d
right.
VISITOR : But let’s consider a pattern that will exhibit them more clearly.
THEAETETUS : What pattern is that?
VISITOR : This one. Pay attention to me, and try to do a good job of
answering my questions.
THEAETETUS : Which questions?
VISITOR : If someone claimed that by a single kind of expertise he could
know, not just how to say things or to contradict people, but how to make
and do everything, then . . .
THEAETETUS : What do you mean, everything? e
VISITOR : You don’t understand the ﬁrst thing I say! Seemingly you don’t
understand everything!
THEAETETUS : No, I don’t.
VISITOR : Well, I mean everything to include you and me and also the
other animals and plants . . .
THEAETETUS : What are you talking about?
VISITOR : If someone claimed that he’d make you and me and all the
other living things . . .
THEAETETUS : What kind of making are you talking about? You’re not 234
talking about some kind of gardener —after all, you did say he made an-
imals.
VISITOR : Yes, and also I mean the sea and earth and heaven and gods
and everything else. And furthermore he makes them each quickly and
sells them at a low price.
THEAETETUS : You’re talking about some kind of game for schoolchildren.
VISITOR : Well, if someone says he knows everything and would teach it
to someone else cheaply and quickly, shouldn’t we think it’s a game?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Do you know of any game that involves more expertise than b
imitation does, and is more engaging?
THEAETETUS : No, not at all, since you’ve collected everything together
and designated a very broad, extremely diverse type.
VISITOR : So think about the man who promises he can make everything
by means of a single kind of expertise. Suppose that by being expert atSophist 255
drawing he produces things that have the same names as real things. Then
we know that when he shows his drawings from far away he’ll be able
to fool the more mindless young children into thinking that he can actually
produce anything he wants to.
THEAETETUS : Of course. c
VISITOR : Well then, won’t we expect that there’s another kind of exper-
tise—this time having to do with words —and that someone can use it to
trick young people when they stand even farther away from the truth
about things? Wouldn’t he do it by putting words in their ears, and by
showing them spoken copies of everything, so as to make them believe
that the words are true and that the person who’s speaking to them is the
wisest person there is?
THEAETETUS : Yes, why shouldn’t there be that kind of expertise too? d
VISITOR : So, Theaetetus, suppose enough time has passed and the soph-
ist’s hearers have gotten older, and that they approach closer to real things
and are forced by their experiences to touch up palpably against them.
Won’t most of them inevitably change their earlier beliefs, which made
large things appear small and easy things appear hard? And won’t the
facts they’ve encountered in the course of their actions completely overturn e
all the appearances that had come to them in the form of words?
THEAETETUS : Yes —at least as far as what someone my age can tell. But
I think I’m one of the young people who are still standing far away from
real things.
VISITOR : That’s why all of us here will keep trying to take you as close
to them as possible, but without your needing those experiences to force
you. But tell me about the sophist. Is it obvious by now that he ’s a kind
of cheat who imitates real things? Or are we still in any doubt about 235
whether he truly knows all the things that he seems to be able to engage
in controversies about?
THEAETETUS : But, sir, how could we be in any doubt? By this time it’s
pretty obvious from what we’ve said that he’s one of those people who
play games.
VISITOR : So we have to regard him as a cheat and an imitator.
THEAETETUS : How could we avoid it?
VISITOR : Well, now it’s our job not to let the beast escape. We’ve
almost hemmed him in with one of those net-like devices that words b
provide for things like this. So anyway he won’t get away from this
next point.
THEAETETUS : What is it?
VISITOR : From being taken to be a kind of magician.
THEAETETUS : That’s what he seems to me to be too.
VISITOR :S oi t ’s settled. We’ll divide the craft of copy-making as quickly
as we can and we’ll go down into it. Then if the sophist gives up right
away we’ll obey the royal command and we’ll capture him and hand our c256 Sophist
catch over to the king. But if the sophist slips down somewhere into the
parts of the craft of imitation, we’ll follow along with him and we’ll divide
each of the parts that contain him until we catch him. Anyway, neither
he nor any other kind will ever be able to boast that he’s escaped from
the method of people who are able to chase a thing through both the
particular and the general.
THEAETETUS : Good. That’s how we have to do it.
VISITOR : Going by the method of division that we’ve used so far, I think
I see two types of imitation here too. But I don’t think I can clearly tell d
yet which one the type or form we’re looking for is in.
THEAETETUS : Well, ﬁrst tell us what distinction you mean.
VISITOR : One type of imitation I see is the art of likeness-making. That’s
the one we have whenever someone produces an imitation by keeping to
the proportions of length, breadth, and depth of his model, and also by e
keeping to the appropriate colors of its parts.
THEAETETUS : But don’t all imitators try to do that?
VISITOR : Not the ones who sculpt or draw very large works. If they
reproduced the true proportions of their beautiful subjects, you see, the
upper parts would appear smaller than they should, and the lower parts 236
would appear larger, because we see the upper parts from farther away
and the lower parts from closer.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR :S od o n ’t those craftsmen say goodbye to truth, and produce
in their images the proportions that seem to be beautiful instead of the
real ones?
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : So can’t the ﬁrst sort of image be called a likeness, since it’s like
the thing?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And as we said before, the part of imitation that deals with that b
should be called likeness-making.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Now, what are we going to call something that appears to be
like a beautiful thing, but only because it’s seen from a viewpoint that’s
not beautiful, and would seem unlike the thing it claims to be like if you
came to be able to see such large things adequately? If it appears the way
the thing does but in fact isn’t like it, isn’t it an appearance?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And this part of imitation covers a great deal of painting and c
of the rest of imitation.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Wouldn’t appearance-making be the right thing to call expertise
in producing appearances that aren’t likenesses?
THEAETETUS : Yes, deﬁnitely.Sophist 257
VISITOR : Well, these are the two types of copy-making I meant, likeness-
making and appearance-making.
THEAETETUS : You were right about that.
VISITOR : But still I can’t see clearly the thing I was in doubt about then,
namely, which type we should put the sophist in. He’s really an amazing
man —very hard to make out. He’s still escaped neatly into an impossibly d
confusing type to search through.
THEAETETUS : It seems that way.
VISITOR : Are you agreeing with me because you know that, or is the
current dragging you, so to speak, into agreement so quickly because the
discussion has given you a habit of agreeing?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean? Why do you say that?
VISITOR : Really, my young friend, this is a very difﬁcult investigation
we’re engaged in. This appearing, and this seeming but not being, and e
this saying things but not true things —all these issues are full of confusion,
just as they always have been. It’s extremely hard, Theaetetus, to say what
form of speech we should use to say that there really is such a thing as
false saying or believing, and moreover to utter this without being caught 237
in a verbal conﬂict.
THEAETETUS : Why?
VISITOR : Because this form of speech of ours involves the rash assumption
that that which is not is, since otherwise falsity wouldn’t come into being.
But when we were boys, my boy, the great Parmenides testiﬁed to us from
start to ﬁnish, speaking in both prose and poetic rhythms, that
Never shall this force itself on us, that that which is not may be;
While you search, keep your thought far away from this path.8
So we have his testimony to this. And our own way of speaking itself b
would make the point especially obvious if it we examined it a little. So
if it’s all the same to you, let’s look at that ﬁrst.
THEAETETUS : As far as I’m concerned you can do what you want. But as
far as our way of speaking is concerned, think about how it will go best,
and follow along with it and take me along the road with you.
VISITOR : That’s what we have to do. Tell me: do we dare to utter the
sound that which in no way is?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But suppose one of our listeners weren’t debating or playing a
game but had to think seriously and answer the following question: What c
should the name, that which is not, be applied to? Why do we think he’d
8. See Parmenides, frg. 7, ll.1 –2. The same lines reoccur, with one slight textual differ-
ence, at 258d.258 Sophist
use it, and in what connection, and for what kind of purpose? And what
would he indicate by it to someone else who wanted to ﬁnd out about it?
THEAETETUS : That’s a hard question. In fact, it’s just about completely,
impossibly confusing for someone like me to answer.
VISITOR : But anyway this much is obvious to us, that that which is not
can’t be applied to any of those which are.
THEAETETUS : Of course not.
VISITOR : So if you can’t apply it to that which is, it wouldn’t be right
either to apply it to something.
THEAETETUS : Why not?
VISITOR :I t’s obvious to us that we always apply this something to a being, d
since it’s impossible to say it by itself, as if it were naked and isolated
from all beings. Isn’t that right?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Are you agreeing because you’re thinking that a person who
says something has to be saying some onething?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Since you’d say that something is a sign of one, and that a couple
of things is a sign of two, and somethings is a sign of a plurality?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And it’s absolutely necessary, it seems, that someone who does e
not say something says nothing9at all.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Therefore don’t we have to refuse to admit that a person like
that speaks but says nothing? Instead, don’t we have to deny that anyone
who tries to utter that which is not is even speaking?
THEAETETUS : Then our way of speaking would have reached the height
of confusion.
VISITOR : Don’t do any boasting yet. There are still more confusions to 238
come, including the primary and most fundamental one, which actually
happens to be at the source of the whole problem.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean? Don’t hold back. Tell me.
VISITOR : To that which is there might belong some other of those
which are.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But shall we say that any of those which are can ever belong
to that which is not?
THEAETETUS : How could they?
VISITOR : Now then, we take all the numbers to be beings.
THEAETETUS : Yes, if we take anything else to be. b
VISITOR : Then let’s not even try to apply either plurality of number or
one to that which is not.
9. Note that the Greek word for “nothing,” me¯den, literally means something like “not
even one” (me¯de hen).Sophist 259
THEAETETUS : Our way of speaking itself tells us that it would be wrong
to try to.
VISITOR : Then how would anyone try either to say those which are not or
that which is not out loud, or even grasp them in thought, apart from
number?
THEAETETUS : Tell me.
VISITOR : Whenever we speak of those which are not, aren’t we trying to c
apply numerical plurality to them?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And when we speak of that which is not aren’t we applying one
to it?
THEAETETUS : Obviously.
VISITOR : But we say it isn’t either right or correct to try to attach that
which is to that which is not.
THEAETETUS : That’s absolutely true.
VISITOR : Do you understand, then, that it’s impossible to say, speak, or
think that which is not itself correctly by itself? It’s unthinkable, unsayable,
unutterable, and unformulable in speech.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : So was I wrong just now when I said that I would formulate d
the biggest confusion about it, when we have this other one to state which
is even bigger?
THEAETETUS : What is it?
VISITOR : My good young friend, don’t you notice on the basis of the
things we said that that which is not even confuses the person who’s refuting
it in just this way, that whenever someone tries to refute it, he’s forced to
say mutually contrary things about it?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean? Say it more clearly.
VISITOR : You shouldn’t expect more clarity from me. I was the one who
made the statement that that which is not should not share either in oneor e
inplurality. But even so I’ve continued after all that to speak of it as one,
since I say that which is not. You understand?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And again a little earlier I said that it isunutterable, unsayable,
and inexpressible in speech. Do you follow?
THEAETETUS : I follow, of course.
VISITOR : So in trying to attach being to it wasn’t I saying things that were 239
the contrary of what I’d said before?
THEAETETUS : Apparently.
VISITOR : And in attaching that which,10wasn’t I speaking of it as one?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
10. Accepting the conjecture to“to,” translated by “that which” on the view that it is
part of the phrase to me¯on, which is generally translated by “that which is not.” In Greek
the form is singular (in contrast with ta, for example, “those which”).260 Sophist
VISITOR : And also in speaking of it as something inexpressible in speech,
unsayable, and unutterable, I was speaking of it as one thing.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But we say that if someone speaks correctly he shouldn’td e ﬁ-
nitely ﬁx it as either one or plural. He shouldn’t even call it itat all, since
even calling it by that label he’d be addressing it by means of the form, one.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : Then what would somebody say about me? He’d ﬁnd that the b
refutation of that which is not has been defeating me for a long time. So,
as I said, let’s not use what I say to help us think of how to speak correctly
about that which is not. Come on, let’s use what you say instead.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
VISITOR : Come on, pull yourself together for us as well as you can and
try it —since you’re young. Try to say something correct about that which
is not, without attaching either being, one, or numerical plurality to it.
THEAETETUS :I’d have to have a strangely large amount of enthusiasm c
for the project to try it myself after seeing what you’ve gone through.
VISITOR : Well, let’s give up on both you and me, if you prefer. But until
we meet someone who can do it let’s say that the sophist has stopped at
nothing. He’s escaped down into inaccessible confusion.
THEAETETUS : He certainly seems to have.
VISITOR : So if we say he has some expertise in appearance-making, it
will be easy for him to grab hold of our use of words in return and twist d
our words in the contrary direction. Whenever we call him a copy-maker
he’ll ask us what in the world we mean by a “copy.” We need to think,
Theaetetus, about how to answer the young man’s question.
THEAETETUS : Obviously we’ll say we mean copies in water and mirrors,
and also copies that are drawn and stamped and everything else like
that.
VISITOR : Evidently, Theaetetus, you haven’t seen a sophist. e
THEAETETUS : Why do you say that?
VISITOR :H e’ll seem to you to have his eyes shut, or else not to have any
eyes at all.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR :H e ’ll laugh at what you say when you answer him that way,
with talk about things in mirrors or sculptures, and when you speak
to him as if he could see. He’ll pretend he doesn’t know about mirrors 240
or water or even sight, and he’ll put his question to you only in terms
of words.
THEAETETUS : What sort of question?
VISITOR :H e ’ll ask about what runs through all those things which you
call many, but which you thought you should call by the one name, copy,
to cover them all, as if they were all one thing. Say something, then, and
defend yourself, and don’t give any ground to him.Sophist 261
THEAETETUS : What in the world would we say a copy is, sir, except
something that’s made similar to a true thing and is another thing that’s b
like it?
VISITOR : You’re saying it’s another true thing like it? Or what do you
mean by like it?
THEAETETUS : Not that it’s true at all, but that it resembles the true thing.
VISITOR : Meaning by true, really being?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And meaning by not true, contrary of true?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : So you’re saying that that which is like is not really that which
is, if you speak of it as not true.
THEAETETUS : But it is, in a way.
VISITOR : But not truly, you say.
THEAETETUS : No, except that it really is a likeness.
VISITOR :S oi t ’s not really what is, but it really is what we call a likeness?
THEAETETUS : Maybe that which is not is woven together with that which c
isin some way like that —it’s quite bizarre.
VISITOR : Of course it’s strange. Anyway, you can see that the many-
headed sophist is still using this interweaving to force us to agree unwill-
ingly that that which is not in a way is.
THEAETETUS :Id e ﬁnitely do see it.
VISITOR : Well then, how can we deﬁne his ﬁeld of expertise, so as to
be consistent?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean? What kind of problem are you afraid of?
VISITOR : When we say that he deceives us about appearances and that d
he’s an expert at deception, are we saying so because his expertise makes
our souls believe what is false? Or what shall we say?
THEAETETUS : Just that. What else would we say?
VISITOR : Again, a false belief will be a matter of believing things that are
contrary to those which are? Or what?
THEAETETUS : Yes, contrary.
VISITOR : So you’re saying that a false belief is believing those which
are not.
THEAETETUS : Necessarily.
VISITOR : Believing that those which are not are not, or that those which e
in no way are in a way are?
THEAETETUS : That those which are not are in a way, it has to be, if anyone
is ever going to be even a little bit wrong.
VISITOR : Well, doesn’t a false belief also believe that those which com-
pletely are in no way are?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And this is false too?
THEAETETUS : Yes.262 Sophist
VISITOR : And I think we’ll also regard false speaking the same way, as 241
saying that those which are are not, and that those which are not are.
THEAETETUS : How else would it be false?
VISITOR : I don’t suppose there’s any other way. The sophist, though, is
going to deny that this way is possible. And how could any sensible person
accept it, now that what we agreed to earlier has been reinforced.11Do we
understand what he’s saying, Theaetetus?
THEAETETUS : How could we not understand that when we dare to say
that falsity is in beliefs and words contain falsity, we’re saying what is
contrary to what we said just before. We’re forced to attach that which is b
to that which is not, even though we agreed just now that that’s com-
pletely impossible.
VISITOR : Your memory’s correct. But think about what we need to do
about the sophist. You see how many and easily available his supply of
objections and confusions is if we assume, as we search for him, that he’s
an expert at cheating and falsehood-making.
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.
VISITOR :H e ’s got a practically inﬁnite supply of them, and we’ve gone c
through only a small fraction.
THEAETETUS : If so, then it seems it would be impossible to catch him.
VISITOR : What, then? Are we going to go soft and give up?
THEAETETUS : I say we shouldn’t, if there’s even the smallest chance that
we can catch him.
VISITOR : So you’ll be forgiving and, as you said, happy if we can somehow
extricate ourselves even slightly from such a powerful argument?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Then I’ve got something even more urgent to request. d
THEAETETUS : What?
VISITOR : Not to think that I’m turning into some kind of patricide.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
VISITOR : In order to defend ourselves we’re going to have to subject
father Parmenides’ saying to further examination, and insist by brute force
both that that which is not somehow is, and then again that that which is
somehow is not.
THEAETETUS : It does seem that in what we’re going to say, we’ll to have
toﬁght through that issue.
VISITOR : That’s obvious even to a blind man, as they say. We’ll never be e
able to avoid having to make ourselves ridiculous by saying conﬂicting
things whenever we talk about false statements and beliefs, either as copies
or likenesses or imitations or appearances, or about whatever sorts of
expertise there are concerning those things —unless, that is, we either refute
Parmenides’ claims or else agree to accept them.
11. I.e., 237a –238c, reinforced by 238d –239c.Sophist 263
THEAETETUS : That’s true.
VISITOR : So that’s why we have to be bold enough to attack what our 242
father says. Or, if fear keeps us from doing that, then we’ll have to leave
it alone completely.
THEAETETUS : Fear, anyway, isn’t going to stop us.
VISITOR : Well then, I’ve got a third thing to ask you, something small.
THEAETETUS : Just tell me what it is.
VISITOR : When I was talking a minute ago I said that I’ve always given
up whenever I’ve tried to refute what Parmenides said, just the way I did
this time.
THEAETETUS : Yes, you did say that.
VISITOR :I’m afraid I’ll seem insane to you if I’m always shifting my
position back and forth, given what I’ve said. It’s for your sake that we’ll b
be trying to refute what Parmenides said —ifwe can do it.
THEAETETUS : Go ahead, then. Don’t worry about that. I won’t think you’re
behaving inappropriately in any way if you go right ahead with your
refutation and demonstration.
VISITOR : Well then, how shall I begin this dangerous discussion? The
path we absolutely have to turn onto, my boy, is this.
THEAETETUS : Namely, ...?
VISITOR : We have to reconsider whether we may not be somehow con-
fused about things that now seem to be clear, and whether over-hasty c
judgment may make us agree too easily.
THEAETETUS : Say what you mean more clearly.
VISITOR : Parmenides’ way of talking to us has been rather easygoing, it
seems to me. So does the way of talking that everyone uses who has ever
urged us to specify just how many beings there are and what they’re like.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : They each appear to me to tell us a myth, as if we were children.
One tells us that there are three beings, and that sometimes they’re some-
how at war with each other, while at other times they become friendly, d
marry, give birth, and bring up their offspring. Another one says that there
are two beings, wet and dry or hot and cold. He marries them off and
makes them set up house together. And our Eleatic tribe, starting from
Xenophanes and even people before him, tells us their myth on the assump-
tion that what they call “all things” are just one.12Later on, some Ionian
and Sicilian muses both had the idea that it was safer to weave the two e
views together. They say that that which is is both many and one, and is
bound by both hatred and friendship. According to the terser of these
muses, in being taken apart they’re brought together.13The more relaxed
12. This group includes Parmenides of Elea (the Visitor, of course, comes from there).
13. The reference here is to Heraclitus, who was Ionian. See frg. 51 (cf. Plato, Symp. 187a).muses, though, allow things to be free from that condition sometimes.  
They say that all that there is alternates, and that sometimes it’s one and 
friendly under Aphrodite’s influence, but at other times it’s many and at  
war with itself because of some kind of strife.14 It’s hard to say whether 
any one of these thinkers has told us the truth or not, and it wouldn’t be  
appropriate for us to be critical of such renowned and venerable men. But 
it wouldn’t be offensive to note the following thing, either.
THEAETETUS : What?
VISITOR: That they’ve overlooked the many of us and belittled us. 
They’ve simply been talking their way through their explanations, without  
paying any attention to whether we were following them or were left  
behind.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
VISITOR: For heaven’s sake, Theaetetus, do you understand anything of 
what they mean each time one of them says that many or one or two  
things are or have become  or are becoming , or when another one speaks of  
hot mixed with cold and supposes that there are separations and combina -
tions?15 Earlier in my life I used to think I understood exactly what someone  
meant when he said just what we’re confused about now, namely, this is 
not. You do see what confusion we’re in about it?
THEAETETUS : Yes, I do.
VISITOR: But just perhaps the very same thing has happened to us equally 
about is. We say we’re in the clear about it, and that we understand when  
someone says it, but that we don’t understand is not. But maybe we’re in 
the same state about both.
THEAETETUS : Maybe.
VISITOR: And let’s suppose the same thing may be true of the other  
expressions we’ve just used.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR: We can look into most of them later, if that seems to be the  
best thing to do. Now we’ll think about the most fundamental and most  
important expression.
THEAETETUS : Which one? Oh, obviously you’re saying that being is the 
one we have to explore first—that we have to ask what people who say  
it think they’re indicating by it.
VISITOR: You understand exactly, Theaetetus. I’m saying we have to  
follow the track this way. Let’s ask—as if they were here—“Listen, you  
people who say that all things are just some two things, hot and cold or  
some such pair. What are you saying about them both when you say that  
they both are  and each one is? What shall we take this being to be? Is it a

third thing alongside those two beings, so that according to you everything
is no longer two but three? Surely in calling one or the other of the two
of them being, you aren’t saying that they both are, since then in either
case they’d be one and not two.”
THEAETETUS : That’s true.
VISITOR :“But you do want to call both of them being?”
THEAETETUS : Probably.
VISITOR :“But,” we’ll say, “if you did that, friends, you’d also be saying 244
very clearly that the two are one.”
THEAETETUS : That’s absolutely right.
VISITOR :“Then clarify this for us, since we’re confused about it. What
do you want to signify when you say being? Obviously you’ve known for
a long time. We thought we did, but now we’re confused about it. So ﬁrst
teach it to us, so we won’t think we understand what you’re saying when
just the contrary is the case.” Would it be the least bit inappropriate for b
us to ask them this, and anyone else who says that everything is more
than one?
THEAETETUS : Not at all.
VISITOR : Well, then, shouldn’t we do our best to ﬁnd out from the
people who say that everything is one what they mean by being?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Then they should answer this question: “Do you say that only
one thing is?”“ We do,” they’ll say, won’t they?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR :“Well then, you call something being?”
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR :“Is that just what you call one, so that you use two names for c
the same thing? Or what?”
THEAETETUS : How will they answer that question?
VISITOR : Obviously it’s not the easiest thing in the world to answer that
question —or any other question, either —for someone who makes the
supposition that they do.
THEAETETUS : Why not?
VISITOR : Surely it’s absurd for someone to agree that there are two names
when he maintains that there’s only one thing.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And it’s completely absurd, and unacceptable, for someone to
say that there’s a name if there’s no account of it. d
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
VISITOR : If he supposes that a thing is different from its name, then surely
he’s mentioning two things.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And moreover if he supposes that the name is the same as the
thing, he’ll either be forced to say that the name is the name of nothing,266 Sophist
or else, if he says that it’s the name of something, then it’s the name of
nothing other than itself and so will turn out to be only the name of a
name and nothing else.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And also the one, being the name of the one, will also be the one
of the name.16
THEAETETUS : It will have to be.
VISITOR : Well then, will they say that the whole is different from the one
being, or the same as it?
THEAETETUS : Of course they’ll say it’s the same, and they do. e
VISITOR : But suppose a whole is, as even Parmenides says,
All around like the bulk of a well-formed sphere,
Equal-balanced all ways from the middle, since neither anything
more
Must it be, this way or that way, nor anything less.
If it’s like that, then that which is will have a middle and extremities. And
if it has those then it absolutely has to have parts, doesn’t it?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : But if a thing has parts then nothing keeps it from having the 245
characteristic of being one in all its parts, and in that way it’s all being
and it’s also one whole.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But something with that characteristic can’t be just the one itself,
can it?
THEAETETUS : Why not?
VISITOR : Surely a thing that’s truly one, properly speaking, has to be
completely without parts.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : But a thing like what we’ve described, which consists of many b
parts, won’t ﬁt that account.
THEAETETUS : I understand.
VISITOR : Now if that which is has the characteristic of the one in this
way, will it be one and a whole? Or shall we simply deny it’s a whole at all?
THEAETETUS : That’s a hard choice.
VISITOR : You’re right. If it has the characteristic of somehow being one,
it won’t appear to be the same as the one. Moreover, everything will then
be more than one.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
16. Plato is relying on the thought that if the terms “one” and “name” designate one
thing (in the sense that he assumes is relevant), then they are interchangeable, even to
the point of generating the strange phrase “the one of the name.”Sophist 267
VISITOR : Further if that which is is not a whole by possessing that as a c
characteristic, but rather just is the whole itself, that which is will turn out
to be less than itself.
THEAETETUS : Certainly.
VISITOR : And because it’s deprived of itself, that which is will be not being,
according to that account.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And everything will be more than one, since that which is and
the whole will each have its own separate nature.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : But if the whole is not at all, then the very same things are true
ofthat which is, and in addition to not being, it would not even become d
a being.
THEAETETUS : Why not?
VISITOR : Invariably whatever becomes has at some point become as a
whole. So we can’t label either being orbecoming as being without taking
the whole to be among the beings too.
THEAETETUS : That seems entirely right.
VISITOR : And moreover something that isn’t a whole can’tb eo fa n y
quantity at all, since something that’s of a certain quantity has to be a
whole of that quantity, whatever it may be.
THEAETETUS : Exactly.
VISITOR : And millions of other issues will also arise, each generating
indeﬁnitely many confusions, if you say that being is only two or one. e
THEAETETUS : The ones that just turned up show that. One problem led
to another, and at each step there was more and more difﬁculty and
uncertainty about what we’d just said at the previous stage.
VISITOR : We haven’t gone through all the detailed accounts that people
give of that which is and that which is not, but this is enough. Now we have
to look at the people who discuss the issue in another way. Our aim is to
have them all in view and that way to see that saying what that which is 246
is isn’t a bit easier than saying what that which is not is.
THEAETETUS : So we need to go on to these people too.
VISITOR : It seems that there’s something like a battle of gods and giants
among them, because of their dispute with each other over being.17
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : One group drags everything down to earth from the heavenly
region of the invisible, actually clutching rocks and trees with their hands.
When they take hold of all these things they insist that only what offers
tangible contact is, since they deﬁne being as the same as body. And if b
any of the others say that something without a body is, they absolutely
despise him and won’t listen to him any more.
17. See Theogony, esp. 675 –715.268 Sophist
THEAETETUS : These are frightening men you’re talking about. I’ve met
quite a lot of them already.
VISITOR : Therefore the people on the other side of the debate defend
their position very cautiously, from somewhere up out of sight. They insist
violently that true being is certain nonbodily forms that can be thought
about. They take the bodies of the other group, and also what they call
the truth, and they break them up verbally into little bits and call them a c
process of coming-to-be instead of being. There’s a never-ending battle
going on constantly between them about this issue.
THEAETETUS : That’s true.
VISITOR : Let’s talk with each of these groups about the being that they
posit.
THEAETETUS : How shall we do it?
VISITOR :I t’s easier to talk with the ones who put being in the forms.
They’re gentler people. It’s harder —and perhaps just about impossible —
with the ones who drag everything down to body by force. It seems to d
me that we have to deal with them this way.
THEAETETUS : Namely ...?
VISITOR : Mainly by making them actually better than they are —if we
somehow could. But if we can’t do that in fact, then let’s do it in words,
by supposing that they’re willing to answer less wildly than they actually
do. Something that better people agree to is worth more than what worse
ones agree to. Anyway we’re not concerned with the people; we’re looking
for what’s true.
THEAETETUS : That’s absolutely right. e
VISITOR : Then tell the better people to answer you and interpret what
they say.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : Then let them tell us this: do they say that anything is a mor-
tal animal?
THEAETETUS : Of course they do.
VISITOR : And they agree that a mortal animal is an ensouled body?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And so they’re placing soul among the beings? 247
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : What then? Do they say that this soul is just and that soul is
unjust, and that this one’s intelligent and that one isn’t?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But isn’t a soul just by the possession and presence of justice,
and isn’t another soul contrary to it by the possession and presence of
the contrary?
THEAETETUS : Yes, they agree with that.
VISITOR : But they’ll say further that at any rate what can be present to
a thing or absent from it is something.THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR: So since there is justice and intelligence and the rest of virtue,  
and also their contraries, and moreover since there is a soul in which those  
things come to be present, do they say that any of these are visible or  
touchable, or that they all are invisible?
THEAETETUS : They can hardly say any of them is visible.
VISITOR: And what about these invisible things? Do they say that they 
have bodies?
THEAETETUS : They don’t give one single answer to that question. They 
do say that the soul seems to them to have a kind of body. But as far as 
intelligence and the other things you’ve asked about are concerned, they’re  
ashamed and don’t dare either to agree that they are not beings or to insist  
that they are all bodies.
VISITOR: Obviously this breed of men has improved, Theaetetus. The  
native earthborn giants would never have been ashamed to hold the line  
for their position, that anything they can’t squeeze in their hands is abso -
lutely nothing.
THEAETETUS : That pretty much describes their thinking.
VISITOR: Then let’s go back to questioning them. It’s enough if they admit 
that even a small part of that which is doesn’t have body. They need to  
say something about what’s common to both it and the things that do 
have body, which they focus on when they say that they both are. Maybe 
that will raise some confusion for them. If it does, then think about whether 
they’d be willing to accept our suggestion that that which is  is something  
like the following.
THEAETETUS : Like what? Tell me and maybe we’ll know.
VISITOR: I’m saying that a thing really is if it has any capacity at all,  
either by nature to do something to something else or to have even the  
smallest thing done to it by even the most trivial thing, even if it only  
happens once. I’ll take it as a definition that those which are amount to  
nothing other than capacity .
THEAETETUS : They accept that, since they don’t have anything better to  
say right now.
VISITOR: Fine. Maybe something else will occur to them later, and to us  
too. For now let’s agree with them on this much. 
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR: Let’s turn to the other people, the friends of the forms. You 
serve as their interpreter for us.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR: You people distinguish coming-to-be and being and say that
they are separate? Is that right?
THEAETETUS : “Yes.”
VISITOR: And you say that by our bodies and through perception we  
have dealings with coming-to-be, but we deal with real being by our souls  Sophist  269
b
c
d
e
248270 Sophist
and through reasoning. You say that being always stays the same and in
the same state, but coming-to-be varies from one time to another.
THEAETETUS :“We do say that.” b
VISITOR : And what shall we say this dealing with is that you apply in the
two cases? Doesn’t it mean what we said just now?
THEAETETUS :“What?”
VISITOR : What happens when two things come together, and by some
capacity one does something to the other or has something done to it. Or
maybe you don’t hear their answer clearly, Theaetetus. But I do, probably
because I’m used to them.
THEAETETUS : Then what account do they give?
VISITOR : They don’t agree with what we just said to the earth people c
about being.
THEAETETUS : What’s that?
VISITOR : We took it as a sufﬁcient deﬁnition of beings that the capacity
be present in a thing to do something or have something done to it, to or
by even the smallest thing or degree.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : In reply they say that coming-to-be has the capacity to do some-
thing or have something done to it, but that this capacity doesn’t ﬁt
with being.
THEAETETUS : Is there anything to that?
VISITOR : We have to reply that we need them to tell us more clearly d
whether they agree that the soul knows and also that being is known.
THEAETETUS :“Yes,” they say.
VISITOR : Well then, do you say that knowing and being known are cases
of doing, or having something done, or both? Is one of them doing and
the other having something done? Or is neither a case of either?
THEAETETUS : Obviously that neither is a case of either, since otherwise
they’d be saying something contrary to what they said before.
VISITOR : Oh, I see. You mean that if knowing is doing something, then e
necessarily what is known has something done to it. When being is known
by knowledge, according to this account, then insofar as it’s known it’s
changed by having something done to it —which we say wouldn’t happen
to something that’s at rest.
THEAETETUS : That’s correct.
VISITOR : But for heaven’s sake, are we going to be convinced that it’s
true that change, life, soul, and intelligence are not present in that which
wholly is, and that it neither lives nor thinks, but stays changeless, solemn, 249
and holy, without any understanding?
THEAETETUS : If we did, sir, we’d be admitting something frightening.
VISITOR : But are we going to say that it has understanding but doesn ’t
have life?
THEAETETUS : Of course not.VISITOR: But are we saying that it has both those things in it while denying  
that it has them in a soul?
THEAETETUS : How else would it have them?
VISITOR: And are we saying that it has intelligence, life, and soul, but 
that it’s at rest and completely changeless even though it’s alive?
THEAETETUS : All that seems completely unreasonable.
VISITOR: Then both that which changes and also change have to be admitted  
as being.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR: And so, Theaetetus, it turns out that if no beings change then  
nothing anywhere possesses any intelligence about anything.18
THEAETETUS : Absolutely not.
VISITOR: But furthermore if we admit that everything is moving and  
changing, then on that account we take the very same thing away from  
those which are.
THEAETETUS : Why?
VISITOR: Do you think that without rest anything would be the same, in 
the same state in the same respects?
THEAETETUS : Not at all.
VISITOR: Well then, do you see any case in which intelligence is or comes-
to-be anywhere without these things?
THEAETETUS : Not in the least.
VISITOR: And we need to use every argument we can to fight against 
anyone who does away with knowledge, understanding, and intelligence  
but at the same time asserts anything at all about anything.
THEAETETUS : Definitely.
VISITOR: The philosopher—the person who values these things the  
most—absolutely has to refuse to accept the claim that everything is at  
rest, either from defenders of the one or from friends of the many forms.  
In addition he has to refuse to listen to people who make that which is 
change in every way. He has to be like a child begging for “both,” and  
say that that which is—everything—is both the unchanging and that 
which changes.
THEAETETUS : True.
VISITOR: Well now, apparently we’ve done a fine job of making our  
account pull together that which is, haven’t we?
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR: But for heaven’s sake, Theaetetus, . . . NowI think we’ll recognize  
how confused our investigation about it is.
THEAETETUS : Why, though? What do you mean?
VISITOR: Don’t you notice, my young friend, that we’re now in extreme  
ignorance about it, though it appears to us that we’re saying something.

e272 Sophist
THEAETETUS : It does to me anyway. But I don’t completely understand
how we got into this situation without noticing.
VISITOR : Then think more clearly about it. Given what we’ve just agreed
to, would it be fair for someone to ask us the same question we earlier 250
asked the people who say that everything is just hotand cold?
THEAETETUS : What was it? Remind me.
VISITOR : Certainly. And I’ll try, at any rate, to do it by asking you in
just the same way as I asked them, so that we can move forward at the
same pace.
THEAETETUS : Good.
VISITOR : Now then, wouldn’t you say that change and rest are completely
contrary to each other?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And you’d say they both equally are, and that each of them
equally is?
THEAETETUS : Yes. b
VISITOR : When you admit that they are, are you saying that both and
each of them change?
THEAETETUS : Not at all.
VISITOR : And are you signifying that they rest when you say that they
both are?
THEAETETUS : Of course not.
VISITOR : So do you conceive that which is as a third thing alongside them
which encompasses rest and change? And when you say that they both
are, are you taking the two of them together and focusing on their associa-
tion with being?
THEAETETUS : It does seem probably true that when we say change and c
rest are, we do have a kind of omen of that which is as a third thing.
VISITOR :S othat which is isn’t both change and rest; it’s something different
from them instead.
THEAETETUS : It seems so.
VISITOR : Therefore by its own nature that which is doesn’t either rest
or change.
THEAETETUS : I suppose it doesn’t.
VISITOR : Which way should someone turn his thoughts if he wants to
establish for himself something clear about it?
THEAETETUS : I don’t know.
VISITOR : I don’t think any line is easy. If something isn’t changing, how
can it not be resting? And how can something not change if it doesn’ti n d
any way rest? But now that which is appears to fall outside both of them.
Is that possible?
THEAETETUS : Absolutely not.
VISITOR : In this connection we ought to remember the following.
THEAETETUS : What?Sophist 273
VISITOR : When we were asked what we should apply the name that which
is not to, we became completely confused. Do you remember?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And now aren’t we in just as much confusion about that e
which is?
THEAETETUS : We seem to be in even more confusion, if that’s possible.
VISITOR : Then we’ve now given a complete statement of our confusion.
But there’s now hope, precisely because both that which is and that which
is not are involved in equal confusion. That is, in so far as one of them is
clariﬁed, either brightly or dimly, the other will be too. And if we can’t 251
see either of them, then anyway we’ll push our account of both of them
forward as well as we can.
THEAETETUS : Fine.
VISITOR : Let’s give an account of how we call the very same thing,
whatever it may be, by several names.
THEAETETUS : What, for instance? Give me an example.
VISITOR : Surely we’re speaking of a man even when we name him several
things, that is, when we apply colors to him and shapes, sizes, defects,
and virtues. In these cases and a million others we say that he’s not only
a man but also is good and indeﬁnitely many different things. And similarly b
on the same account we take a thing to be one, and at the same time we
speak of it as many by using many names for it.
THEAETETUS : That’s true.
VISITOR : Out of all this we’ve prepared a feast for young people and for
old late-learners. They can grab hold of the handy idea that it’s impossible
for that which is many to be one and for that which is one to be many.
They evidently enjoy forbidding us to say that a man is good, and only c
letting us say that that which is good is good, or that the man is a man.
You’ve often met people, I suppose, who are carried away by things like
that. Sometimes they’re elderly people who are amazed at this kind of thing,
because their understanding is so poor and they think they’ve discovered
something prodigiously wise.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Then let’s direct our questions now both to these people and d
also to the others we were talking with before. That way our account will
be addressed to everyone who’s ever said anything at all about being.
THEAETETUS : What questions do you mean?
VISITOR : Shall we refuse to apply being to change or to rest, or anything
to anything else? Shall we take these things to be unblended and incapable
of having a share of each other in the things we say? Or shall we pull
them all together and treat them all as capable of associating with each
other? Or shall we say that some can associate and some can’t? Which of
these options shall we say they’d choose, Theaetetus? e
THEAETETUS : I don’t know how to answer for them.274 Sophist
VISITOR : Why don’t you reply to the options one by one by thinking
about what results from each of them?
THEAETETUS : Fine.
VISITOR : First, if you like, let’s take them to say that nothing has any
capacity at all for association with anything. Then change and rest won’t
have any share in being.
THEAETETUS : No, they won’t. 252
VISITOR : Well then, will either of them be, if they have no association
with being?
THEAETETUS : No.
VISITOR : It seems that agreeing to that destroys everything right away,
both for the people who make everything change, for the ones who make
everything an unchanging unit, and for the ones who say that beings are
forms that always stay the same and in the same state. All of these people
apply being. Some do it when they say that things really are changing, and
others do it when they say that things really are at rest.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : Also there are people who put everything together at one time b
and divide them at another.19Some put them together into one and divide
them into indeﬁnitely many, and others divide them into a ﬁnite number
of elements and put them back together out of them. None of these people,
regardless of whether they take this to happen in stages or continuously,
would be saying anything if there isn’t any blending.
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : But furthermore the most ridiculous account is the one that’s
adopted by the people who won’t allow anything to be called by a name
that it gets by association with something else.
THEAETETUS : Why? c
VISITOR : They’re forced to use being about everything, and also separate,
from others, of itself, and a million other things. They’re powerless to keep
from doing it —that is, from linking them together in their speech. So they
don’t need other people to refute them, but have an enemy within, as
people say, to contradict them, and they go carrying him around talking
in an undertone inside them like the strange ventriloquist Eurycles.20
THEAETETUS : That’s a very accurate comparison. d
VISITOR : Well then, what if we admit that everything has the capacity
to associate with everything else?
THEAETETUS : I can solve that one.
VISITOR : How?
THEAETETUS : Because if change and rest belonged to each other then change
would be completely at rest and conversely rest itself would be changing.
19. These thinkers were introduced at 242c –d, e–243a.
20. See Aristophanes, Wasps, 1017 –20.Sophist 275
VISITOR : But I suppose it’s ruled out by very strict necessity that change
should be at rest and that rest should change.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : So the third option is the only one left.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Certainly one of the following things has to be the case: either e
everything is willing to blend, or nothing is, or some things are and some
are not.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And we found that the ﬁrst two options were impossible.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So everyone who wants to give the right answer will choose
the third.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : Since some will blend and some won’t, they’ll be a good deal 253
like letters of the alphabet. Some of them ﬁt together with each other and
some don’t.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : More than the other letters the vowels run through all of them
like a bond, linking them together, so that without a vowel no one of the
others can ﬁt with another.
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.
VISITOR : So does everyone know which kinds of letters can associate
with which, or does it take an expert?
THEAETETUS : It takes an expert.
VISITOR : What kind?
THEAETETUS : An expert in grammar.
VISITOR : Well then, isn’t it the same with high and low notes? The b
musician is the one with the expertise to know which ones mix and
which ones don’t, and the unmusical person is the one who doesn’t
understand that.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And in other cases of expertise and the lack of it we’ll ﬁnd
something similar.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Well then, we’ve agreed that kinds mix with each other in the
same way. So if someone’s going to show us correctly which kinds harmo-
nize with which and which kinds exclude each other, doesn’t he have to
have some kind of knowledge as he proceeds through the discussion? And c
in addition doesn’t he have to know whether there are any kinds that run
through all of them and link them together to make them capable of
blending, and also, when there are divisions, whether certain kinds running
through wholes are always the cause of the division?
THEAETETUS : Of course that requires knowledge —probably just about
the most important kind.276 Sophist
VISITOR : So, Theaetetus, what shall we label this knowledge? Or for
heaven’s sake, without noticing have we stumbled on the knowledge that
free people have? Maybe we’ve found the philosopher even though we
were looking for the sophist?
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
VISITOR : Aren’t we going to say that it takes expertise in dialectic to d
divide things by kinds and not to think that the same form is a different
one or that a different form is the same?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So if a person can do that, he’ll be capable of adequately discrimi-
nating a single form spread out all through a lot of other things, each of
which stands separate from the others. In addition he can discriminate
forms that are different from each other but are included within a single
form that’s outside them, or a single form that’s connected as a unit
throughout many wholes, or many forms that are completely separate
from others.21That’s what it is to know how to discriminate by kinds how e
things can associate and how they can’t.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : And you’ll assign this dialectical activity only to someone who
has a pure and just love of wisdom.
THEAETETUS : You certainly couldn’t assign it to anyone else.
VISITOR :W e ’llﬁnd that the philosopher will always be in a location like
this if we look for him. He’s hard to see clearly too, but not in the same 254
way as the sophist.
THEAETETUS : Why not?
VISITOR : The sophist runs off into the darkness of that which is not, which
he’s had practice dealing with, and he’s hard to see because the place is
so dark. Isn’t that right?
THEAETETUS : It seems to be.
VISITOR : But the philosopher always uses reasoning to stay near the form,
being.H ei s n ’t at all easy to see because that area is so bright and the eyes
of most people’s souls can’t bear to look at what’s divine. b
THEAETETUS : That seems just as right as what you just said before.
VISITOR :W e ’ll think about the philosopher more clearly soon if we want
to. But as far as the sophist is concerned we obviously shouldn’t give up
until we’ve gotten a good enough look at him.
THEAETETUS : Fine.
21. Alternatively, the two previous sentences can be translated: “So if a person can do
that, he’ll adequately discriminate a single form spread out all through many, each of
which stands separate from the others, and many forms that are different from each
other but are included within a single form that’s outside them; and another single form
connected as a unit through many wholes, and many forms that are all marked off
in separation.”Sophist 277
VISITOR :W e ’ve agreed on this: some kinds will associate with each other
and some won’t, some will to a small extent and others will associate a
great deal, nothing prevents still others from being all-pervading —from c
being associated with every one of them. So next let’s pursue our account
together this way. Let’s not talk about every form. That way we won’tb e
thrown off by dealing with too many of them. Instead let’s choose some
of the most important ones. First we’ll ask what they’re like, and next
we’ll ask about their ability to associate with each other. Even if our grasp
ofthat which is and that which is not isn’t completely clear, our aim will be
to avoid being totally without an account of them —so far as that’s allowed
by our present line of inquiry —and see whether we can get away with d
saying that that which is not really is that which is not.
THEAETETUS : That’s what we have to do.
VISITOR : The most important kinds we’ve just been discussing are that
which is, rest, and change.
THEAETETUS : Yes, by far.
VISITOR : And we say that two of them don’t blend with each other.
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely not.
VISITOR : But that which is blends with both of them, since presumably
both of them are.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : We do have three of them.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So each of them is different from two of them, but is the same
as itself.
THEAETETUS : Yes. e
VISITOR : But what in the world are the same and the different that we’ve
been speaking of? Are they two kinds other than those three but necessarily
always blending with them? And do we have to think of them all as being
ﬁve and not three? Or have what we’ve been calling the same and the 255
different turned out, without our realizing it, to be among those three?
THEAETETUS : Maybe.
VISITOR : But change and rest are certainly not different orthe same.
THEAETETUS : Why not?
VISITOR : Whatever we call change and rest in common can’t be either
one of them.
THEAETETUS : Why not?
VISITOR : Then change would rest and rest would change. In both cases,
if either change or rest comes to be either same or different, then it will
force the other to change to the contrary of its own nature, since it will b
share in its contrary.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : And both do share in the same and in the different.
THEAETETUS : Yes.278 Sophist
VISITOR : Then anyway let’s not say that change is the same or the different,
nor that rest is.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : But do we have to think of that which is and the same as one thing?
THEAETETUS : Maybe.
VISITOR : But if that which is and the same don’t signify distinct things,
then when we say that change and rest both are, we’ll be labeling both of c
them as being the same.
THEAETETUS : But certainly that’s impossible.
VISITOR :S oi t ’s impossible for the same and that which is to be one.
THEAETETUS : I suppose so.
VISITOR : Shall we take the same as a fourth in addition to the other
three forms?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Well then, do we have to call the different aﬁfth? Or should we
think of it and that which is as two names for one kind?
THEAETETUS : Maybe.
VISITOR : But I think you’ll admit that some of those which are are said
by themselves, but some are always said in relation to other things.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But the different is always said in relation to another, isn’t it? d
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : But it wouldn’tb ei f that which is and the different weren’t
completely distinct. If the different shared in both kinds the way that which
isdoes, then some of the things that are different would be different
without being different in relation to anything different. In fact, though,
it turns out that whatever is different deﬁnitely has to be what it is from
something that’s different.
THEAETETUS : That’s exactly the way it is.
VISITOR : And we do have to call the nature of the different a ﬁfth among e
the forms we’re choosing.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And we’re going to say that it pervades all of them, since each
of them is different from the others, not because of its own nature but
because of sharing in the type of the different.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : Let’s take up each of the ﬁve one by one and say this.
THEAETETUS : What?
VISITOR : First let’s say that change is completely different from rest. Shall
we say that?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So it is not rest.
THEAETETUS : Not at all.
VISITOR : But it is, because it shares in that which is. 256Sophist 279
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Then again change is different from the same.
THEAETETUS : Pretty much.
VISITOR : So it is not the same.
THEAETETUS : No.
VISITOR : But still it was the same, we said,22because everything has a
share of that.
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.
VISITOR : We have to agree without any qualms that change is the same
and not the same. When we say that it’s the same and not the same, we
aren’t speaking the same way. When we say it’s the same, that’s because b
it shares in the same in relation to itself. But when we say it’s not the
same, that’s because of its association with the different. Because of its
association with the different, change is separated from the same, and so
becomes not it but different. So that it’s right to say that it’s not the same.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : So if change itself ever somehow had a share in rest, there would
be nothing strange about labeling it resting?
THEAETETUS : That’s absolutely right, as long as we admit that some kinds
will blend with each other and some won’t.
VISITOR : That, though, we demonstrated earlier, before we came to this c
point, and we showed that by nature it has to be so.23
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : To repeat,24change is different from different, just as it’s other
than both the same and rest.
THEAETETUS : It has to be.
VISITOR : So in a way it is different and not different, according to what
we’ve said.
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : So what next? Are we going to say that change is different from
theﬁrst three but not from the fourth, in spite of the fact that we’ve agreed
that there were ﬁve things we were going to investigate? d
THEAETETUS : How could we do that? We can’t admit that there are fewer
of them than there appeared to be just now.
VISITOR : So shall we go on fearlessly contending that change is different
from that which is?
22. Cf. 255a.
23. At 251a –252c.
24. Alternatively: “Let’s continue, then:” (On this translation, the Visitor is here taking
the next step in his plan announced at 255e8; he has said how change relates to rest and
to the same, and now proceeds to say how it relates to the different —after which, c11
ff., he completes the plan by saying how it relates to being. Thus he is not repeating
anything already said previously.)280 Sophist
THEAETETUS : Yes, we should be absolutely fearless.
VISITOR :S oi t ’s clear that change really is both something that is not, but
also a thing that is since it partakes in that which is?
THEAETETUS : That’s absolutely clear.
VISITOR : So it has to be possible for that which is not to be, in the case of
change and also as applied to all the kinds. That’s because as applied to
all of them the nature of the different makes each of them not be, by making e
it different from that which is. And we’re going to be right if we say that
all of them are not in this same way. And on the other hand we’re also
going to be right if we call them beings, because they have a share in that
which is.
THEAETETUS : It seems that way.
VISITOR : So as concerning each of the forms that which is is extensive,
and that which is not is indeﬁnite in quantity.
THEAETETUS : That seems right.
VISITOR : So we have to say that that which is itself is different from 257
the others.
THEAETETUS : Necessarily.
VISITOR : So even that which is is not, in as many applications as there are
of the others, since, not being them, it is one thing, namely itself, and on
the other hand it is not those others, which are an indeﬁnite number.
THEAETETUS : I suppose so.
VISITOR : So then we shouldn’t even be annoyed about this conclusion,
precisely because it’s the nature of kinds to allow association with each
other. And if somebody doesn’t admit that, then he needs to win us over
from our earlier line of argument for it, in order to win us over from
its consequences.
THEAETETUS : That’s entirely fair.
VISITOR : Now let’s look at this. b
THEAETETUS : What?
VISITOR : It seems that when we say that which is not,w ed o n ’t say some-
thing contrary to that which is, but only something different from it.
THEAETETUS : Why?
VISITOR :I t’s like this. When we speak of something as not large, does it
seem to you that we indicate the small rather than the equal?
THEAETETUS : Of course not.
VISITOR :S ow ew o n ’t agree with somebody who says that negation
signiﬁes a contrary. We’ll only admit this much: when “not” and “non-” c
are preﬁxed to names that follow them, they indicate something other than
the names, or rather, other than the things to which the names following
the negation are applied.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : If you don’t mind, though, let’s think about this.
THEAETETUS : What?Sophist 281
VISITOR : The nature of the different appears to be chopped up, just
like knowledge.
THEAETETUS : Why?
VISITOR : Knowledge is a single thing, too, I suppose. But each part of it
that has to do with something is marked off and has a name peculiar to
itself. That’s why there are said to be many expertises and many kinds d
of knowledge.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And so the same thing happens to the parts of the nature of
the different, too, even though it’s one thing.
THEAETETUS : Maybe. But shall we say how?
VISITOR : Is there a part of the different that’s placed over against the beau-
tiful?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Shall we say that it’s nameless, or does it have a name?
THEAETETUS : It has a name. What we call not beautiful is the thing that’s
different from nothing other than the nature of the beautiful.
VISITOR : Now go ahead and tell me this.
THEAETETUS : What? e
VISITOR : Isn’t it in the following way that the not beautiful turns out to
be, namely, by being both marked off within one kind of those that are,
and also set over against one of those that are?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Then it seems that the not beautiful is a sort of setting of a being
over against a being.
THEAETETUS : That’s absolutely right.
VISITOR : Well then, according to this account, is the beautiful more a
being than the not beautiful?
THEAETETUS : Not at all.
VISITOR : So we have to say that both the not large and the large 258
equally are.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So we also have to put the not just on a par with the just, in
that neither isany more than the other.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And we’ll speak about the others in the same way too, since
the nature of the different appeared as being one of those that are. And
because it is, we have to posit its parts as no less beings.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : So it seems that the setting against each other of the nature of
a part of the different and the nature of that which is is not any less being — b
if we’re allowed to say such a thing —than that which is itself. And it does
not signify something contrary to that which is but only something different
from it.282 Sophist
THEAETETUS : Clearly.
VISITOR : So what shall we call it?
THEAETETUS : Obviously that which is not —which we were looking for
because of the sophist —is just exactly this.
VISITOR : Then does it have just as much being as any of the others, as
you said it did? Should we work up the courage now to say that that which
is not deﬁnitely is something that has its own nature? Should we say that
just as the large was large, the beautiful was beautiful, the not large was not c
large, and the not beautiful was not beautiful, in the same way that which
is not also was and is not being, and is one form among the many that
are? Do we, Theaetetus, still have any doubts about that?
THEAETETUS : No.
VISITOR : You know, our disbelief in Parmenides has gone even farther
than his prohibition.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR :W e ’ve pushed our investigation ahead and shown him some-
thing even beyond what he prohibited us from even thinking about.
THEAETETUS : In what way?
VISITOR : Because he says, remember, d
Never shall it force itself on us, that that which is not may be;
Keep your thought far away from this path of searching.
THEAETETUS : That’s what he says.
VISITOR : But we’ve not only shown that those which are not are. We’ve
also caused what turns out to be the form of that which is not to appear.
Since we showed that the nature of the different is, chopped up among all e
beings in relation to each other, we dared to say that that which is not really
is just this, namely, each part of the nature of the different that’s set over
against that which is.
THEAETETUS : And what we’ve said seems to me completely and totally
true.
VISITOR : Nobody can say that this that which is not, which we’ve made
to appear and now dare to say is, is the contrary of that which is.W e ’ve
said good-bye long ago to any contrary of that which is, and to whether it 259
is or not, and also to whether or not an account can be given of it. With
regard to that which is not, which we’ve said is, let someone refute us and
persuade us that we’ve made a mistake —or else, so long as he can’td o
that, he should say just what we say. He has to say that the kinds blend
with each other, that that which is and the different pervade all of them and
each other, that the different shares in that which is and so, because of that
sharing, is. But he won’t say that it is that which it shares in, but that it
is different from it, and necessarily, because it isdifferent from that which
is, it clearly can be what is not. On the other hand that which is has a share bSophist 283
inthe different, so, being different from all of the others, it is not each of
them and it is not all of the others except itself. So that which is indisputably
is not millions of things, and all of the others together, and also each of
them, are in many ways and also are not in many ways.
THEAETETUS : True.
VISITOR : And if anyone doesn’t believe these contrarieties, he has to think
about them himself and say something better than what we’ve said. But
if he thinks he’s recognized a problem in it and enjoys dragging the c
argument back and forth, then he’s been carried away by something that’s
not worth much of anyone’s attention —to go by what we’ve just been
saying, anyway. A thing like that isn’t clever or hard to discover, but the
other thing is both difﬁcult and at the same time beautiful.
THEAETETUS : What other thing?
VISITOR : The thing we said earlier. That is, we should leave pointless
things like this alone. Instead we should be able to follow what a person
says and scrutinize it step by step. When he says that what’s different is
the same in a certain way or that what’s the same is different in a certain
way, we should understand just what way he means, and the precise d
respect in which he’s saying that the thing is the same or different. But
when someone makes that which is the same appear different in just any
old way, or vice versa, or when he makes what’s large appear small
or something that’s similar appear dissimilar —well, if someone enjoys
constantly trotting out contraries like that in discussion, that’s not true
refutation. It’s only the obvious new-born brain-child of someone who just
came into contact with those which are.25
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.
VISITOR : In fact, my friend, it’s inept to try to separate everything from
everything else. It’s the sign of a completely unmusical and unphilosophi- e
cal person.
THEAETETUS : Why?
VISITOR : To dissociate each thing from everything else is to destroy totally
everything there is to say. The weaving together of forms is what makes
speech possible for us.
THEAETETUS : That’s true.
VISITOR : Think about what a good moment we picked to ﬁght it out 260
against people like that, and to force them further to let one thing blend
with another.
THEAETETUS : Why a good moment?
VISITOR : For speech’s being one kind among those that are. If we were
deprived of that, we’d be deprived of philosophy —to mention the most
important thing. Besides, now we have to agree about what speech is, but
we’d be able to say nothing if speech were taken away from us and weren’t
25. See 234d –e.284 Sophist
anything at all. And it would be taken away if we admitted that there’s b
no blending of anything with anything else.
THEAETETUS : This last thing is right, anyway. But I don’t understand why
we have to agree about speech.
VISITOR : Well, perhaps you’ll understand if you follow me this way.
THEAETETUS : Where?
VISITOR :That which is not appeared to us to be one kind among others,
but scattered over all those which are.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So next we have to think about whether it blends with belief
and speech.
THEAETETUS : Why?
VISITOR : If it doesn’t blend with them then everything has to be true. c
But if it does then there will be false belief and false speech, since falsity
in thinking and speaking amount to believing and saying those that are not.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And if there’s falsity then there’s deception.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And if there’s deception then necessarily the world will be full
of copies, likenesses, and appearances.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : We said that the sophist had escaped into this region, but that
he denied that there has come to be or is such a thing as falsity. For he d
denied that anyone either thinks or says that which is not, on the ground
that that which is not never in any way has a share in being.
THEAETETUS : That’s what he said.
VISITOR : But now it apparently does share in that which is, so he probably
wouldn’t still put up a ﬁght about that. Perhaps, though, he might say
that some forms share in that which is not and some don’t, and that speech
and belief are ones that don’t. So he might contend again that copy-making
and appearance-making —in which we said he was contained —totally are e
not. His ground would be that belief and speech don’t associate with that
which is not, and that without this association falsity totally is not. That’s
why we have to search around for speech, belief, and appearance, and
ﬁrst discover what they are, so that when they appear we see their associa-
tion with that which is not clearly. Then when we’ve seen that clearly we 261
can show that falsity is, and when we’ve shown that we can tie the sophist
up in it, if we can keep hold of him —or else we’ll let him go and look for
him in another kind.
THEAETETUS : What you said at the start seems absolutely true. The sophist
is a hard kind to hunt down. He seems to have a whole supply of road-
blocks, and whenever he throws one down in our way we have to ﬁght
through it before we can get to him. But now when we’ve barely gotten
through the one about how that which is not is not, he’s thrown another
one down and we have to show that falsity is present in both speech and bSophist 285
belief. And next, it seems, there will be another and another after that. A
limit, it seems, never appears.
VISITOR : Even if you can only make a little progress, Theaetetus, you
should cheer up. If you give up in this situation, what will you do some
other time when you don’t get anywhere or even are pushed back? A
person like that would hardly capture a city, as the saying goes. But since c
we’ve done what you just said, my friend, the largest wall may already
have been captured and the rest of them may be lower and easier.
THEAETETUS : Fine.
VISITOR : Then let’s take up speech and belief, as we said just now. That
way we can calculate whether that which is not comes into contact with
them, or whether they’re both totally true and neither one is ever false.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : Come on, then. Let’s think about names again, the same way d
as we spoke about forms and letters of the alphabet. What we’re looking
for seems to lie in that direction.
THEAETETUS : What kind of question about them do we have to answer?
VISITOR : Whether they all ﬁt with each other, or none of them do, or
some of them will and some of them won’t.
THEAETETUS : Anyway it’s clear that some will and some won’t.
VISITOR : Maybe you mean something like this: names that indicate some-
thing when you say them one after another ﬁt together, and names that e
don’t signify anything when you put them in a row don’t ﬁt.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
VISITOR : The same thing I thought you were assuming when you agreed
with me just now —since there are two ways to use your voice to indicate
something about being.
THEAETETUS : What are they?
VISITOR : One kind is called names, and the other is called verbs. 262
THEAETETUS : Tell me what each of them is.
VISITOR : A verb is the sort of indication that’s applied to an action.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And a name is the kind of spoken sign that’s applied to things
that perform the actions.
THEAETETUS :D eﬁnitely.
VISITOR : So no speech is formed just from names spoken in a row, and
also not from verbs that are spoken without names.
THEAETETUS : I didn’t understand that.
VISITOR : Clearly you were focusing on something else when you agreed b
with me just now. What I meant was simply this: things don’t form speech
if they’re said in a row like this.
THEAETETUS : Like what?
VISITOR : For example, “walks runs sleeps,” and other verbs that signify
actions. Even if somebody said all of them one after another that wouldn’t
be speech.286 Sophist
THEAETETUS : Of course not.
VISITOR : Again, if somebody said “lion stag horse,” and whatever names
there are of things that perform actions, the series wouldn’t make up c
speech. The sounds he uttered in the ﬁrst or second way wouldn’t indicate
either an action or an inaction or the being of something that is or of
something that is not —not until he mixed verbs with nouns. But when he
did that, they’d ﬁt together and speech —the simplest and smallest kind
of speech, I suppose —would arise from that ﬁrst weaving of name and
verb together.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
VISITOR : When someone says “man learns,” would you say that’s the
shortest and simplest kind of speech?
THEAETETUS : Yes. d
VISITOR : Since he gives an indication about what is, or comes to be, or
has come to be, or is going to be. And he doesn’t just name, but accomplishes
something, by weaving verbs with names. That’s why we said he speaks
and doesn’t just name. In fact this weaving is what we use the word
“speech” for.
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : So some things ﬁt together and some don’t. Likewise some vocal
signs don’t ﬁt together, but the ones that do produce speech. e
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : But there’s still this small point.
THEAETETUS : What?
VISITOR : Whenever there’s speech it has to be about something. It’s
impossible for it not to be about something.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And speech also has to have some particular quality.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Now let’s turn our attention to ourselves.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR :I’ll produce some speech by putting a thing together with an
action by means of a name and a verb. You have to tell me what it’s about.
THEAETETUS :I’ll do it as well as I can. 263
VISITOR :“Theaetetus sits.” That’s not a long piece of speech, is it?
THEAETETUS : No, not too long.
VISITOR : Your job is to tell what it’s about, what it’s of.
THEAETETUS : Clearly it’s about me, of me.
VISITOR : Then what about this one?
THEAETETUS : What one?
VISITOR :“Theaetetus (to whom I’m now talking) ﬂies.”
THEAETETUS : No one would ever deny that it’s of me and about me.
VISITOR : We also say that each piece of speech has to have some particu-
lar quality.Sophist 287
THEAETETUS : Yes. b
VISITOR : What quality should we say each one of these has?
THEAETETUS : The second one is false, I suppose, and the other one is true.
VISITOR : And the true one says those that are, as they are, about you.26
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And the false one says things different from those that are.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So it says those that are not, but that they are.
THEAETETUS : I suppose so.
VISITOR : But they’re different things that are from the things that are
about you —since we said that concerning each thing many beings are and
many are not.27
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR :I nt h e ﬁrst place, the second piece of speech I said about you c
must be one of the shortest there is, according to our deﬁnition of speech.
THEAETETUS : We agreed to that just now, anyway.
VISITOR : And we agreed that it’s of something.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And if it is not of you, it isn’t of anything else.
THEAETETUS : Of course not.
VISITOR : And if it were not of anything it would not be speech at all,
since we showed that it was impossible for speech that is, to be speech
that is of nothing.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely right.
VISITOR : But if someone says things about you, but says different things d
as the same or not beings as beings, then it deﬁnitely seems that false
speech really and truly arises from that kind of putting together of verbs
and names.
THEAETETUS : Yes, very true.
VISITOR : Well then, isn’t it clear by now that both true and false thought
and belief and appearance can occur in our souls?
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : The best way for you to know how is for you ﬁrst to grasp
what they are and how they’re different from each other. e
THEAETETUS : Then just tell me.
VISITOR : Aren’t thought and speech the same, except that what we call
thought is speech that occurs without the voice, inside the soul in conversa-
tion with itself?
26. This sentence is ambiguous. First, the Greek here uses an idiom which could mean
either “says those that are, as they are” or“says those that are, that they are” (cf. 263d).
Secondly, the additional explanatory phrase, “about you,” could be taken with “says,”
with “are,” or with both.
27. See 256e5 –6.288 Sophist
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And the stream of sound from the soul that goes through the
mouth is called speech?
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : And then again we know that speech contains . . .
THEAETETUS : What?
VISITOR :A fﬁrmation and denial.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So when afﬁrmation or denial occurs as silent thought inside 264
the soul, wouldn’t you call that belief?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : And what if that doesn’t happen on its own but arises for
someone through perception? When that happens, what else could one
call it correctly, besides appearance?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So since there is true and false speech, and of the processes just
mentioned, thinking appeared to be the soul’s conversation with itself,
belief the conclusion of thinking, and what we call appearing the blending b
of perception and belief, it follows that since these are all the same kind
of thing as speech, some of them must sometimes be false.
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : So you realize we’ve found false belief and speech sooner than
we expected to just now. Then we were afraid that to look for it would
be to attack a completely hopeless project.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : So let’s not be discouraged about what’s still left. Since these
other things have come to light, let’s remember the divisions by types that c
we made earlier.
THEAETETUS : Which ones?
VISITOR : We divided copy-making into two types, likeness-making and
appearance-making.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And we said we were confused about which one to put the
sophist in.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And in our confusion about that we plunged into even greater
bewilderment, when an account emerged that disagreed with everyone,
by denying that there are likenesses or copies or appearances at all, on
the ground that there isn’t ever any falsity in any way anywhere. d
THEAETETUS : That’s right.
VISITOR : But now since false speech and false belief both appear to be,
it’s possible for imitations of those that are to be, and for expertise in
deception to arise from that state of affairs.
THEAETETUS : Yes.Sophist 289
VISITOR : And we agreed before that the sophist does fall under one of
the two types we just mentioned.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Then let’s try again to take the kind we’ve posited and cut it
in two. Let’s go ahead and always follow the righthand part of what we’ve e
cut, and hold onto things that the sophist is associated with until we strip
away everything that he has in common with other things. Then when
we’ve left his own peculiar nature, let’s display it, especially to ourselves
but also to people to whom this sort of procedure is naturally congenial. 265
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : Didn’t we begin by dividing expertise into productive and ac-
quisitive?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And under the acquisitive part the sophist appeared in hunting,
combat, wholesaling, and types of that sort.28
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : But now, since he’s included among experts in imitation, ﬁrst
we obviously have to divide productive expertise in two. We say imitation
is a sort of production, but of copies and not of the things themselves. Is b
that right?
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.
VISITOR : First of all, production has two parts.
THEAETETUS : What are they?
VISITOR : Divine and human.
THEAETETUS : I don’t understand yet.
VISITOR : If you remember how we started,29we said production was any
capacity that causes things to come to be that previously were not.
THEAETETUS : I remember.
VISITOR : Take animals and everything mortal, including plants and every- c
thing on the earth that grows from seeds and roots, and also all lifeless
bodies made up inside the earth, whether fusible or not. Are we going to
say that anything besides the craftsmanship of a god makes them come
to be after previously not being? Or shall we rely on the saying and the
widespread belief that ...?
THEAETETUS : That what?
VISITOR : Are we going to say that nature produces them by some sponta-
neous cause that generates them without any thought, or by a cause that
works by reason and divine knowledge derived from a god?
THEAETETUS : I often shift back and forth on that from one view to the d
other, maybe because of my age. When I’m focusing on you now, and
28. See 221c –225a.
29. See 219b.290 Sophist
supposing that you think they come to be by the agency of a god, that ’s
what I think too.
VISITOR : Fine, Theaetetus. If we thought you were the kind of person
who might believe something different in the future we’d try to use some
cogent, persuasive argument to make you agree. But since I know what
your nature is and I know, too, that even without arguments from us it e
will tend in the direction that it’s pulled toward now, I’ll let the issue go.
It would take too much time. I’ll assume divine expertise produces the
things that come about by so-called nature, and that human expertise
produces the things that humans compound those things into. According
to this account there are two kinds of production, human and divine.
THEAETETUS : Right.
VISITOR : Since there are two of them, cut each of them in two again.
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR :I t’sa si fy o u ’d already cut production all the way along its 266
width, and now you’ll cut it along its length.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : That way there are four parts of it all together, two human ones
related to us and two divine ones related to the gods.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Then if we take the division we made the ﬁrst way, one part
of each of those parts is the production of originals. Just about the best
thing to call the two parts that are left might be “copy-making.” That way,
production is divided in two again.
THEAETETUS : Tell me again how each of them is divided. b
VISITOR : We know that we human beings and the other living things,
and also ﬁre, water, and things like that, which natural things come from,
are each generated and produced by a god. Is that right?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : And there are copies of each of these things, as opposed to the
things themselves, that also come about by divine workmanship.
THEAETETUS : What kinds of things?
VISITOR : Things in dreams, and appearances that arise by themselves
during the day. They’re shadows when darkness appears in ﬁrelight, and
they’re reﬂections when a thing’s own light and the light of something c
else come together around bright, smooth surfaces and produce an
appearance that looks the reverse of the way the thing looks from
straight ahead.
THEAETETUS : Yes, those are two products of divine production —the
things themselves and the copies corresponding to each one.
VISITOR : And what about human expertise? We say housebuilding makes
a house itself and drawing makes a different one, like a human dream
made for people who are awake.
THEAETETUS : Of course. dSophist 291
VISITOR : And just the same way in other cases, too, there are pairs of
products of human production, that is, the thing itself, we say, and the
copy.
THEAETETUS : Now I understand better and I take it that there are two
kinds of double production, divine and human in each division. One kind
produces things themselves, and the other kind produces things similar
to them.
VISITOR : Let’s recall that one part of copy-making is likeness-making.
The other kind was going to be appearance-making, if falsity appeared to
be truly falsity and by nature one of those that are. e
THEAETETUS : Yes, it was.
VISITOR : But falsity did turn out that way, so are we going to count
likeness-making and appearance-making as indisputably two forms?
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Then let’s divide appearance-making in two again. 267
THEAETETUS : How?
VISITOR : Into one sort that’s done with tools and one that uses one’s own
self as the tool of the person making the appearance.
THEAETETUS : What do you mean?
VISITOR : When somebody uses his own body or voice to make something
similar to your body or voice, I think the best thing to call this part of
appearance-making is “imitating.”
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Let’s set this part off by calling it imitation, and let’s be lazy
and let the other part go. We’ll leave it to someone else to bring it together b
into a unit and give it a suitable name.
THEAETETUS : All right, let’s take the one and let the other go.
VISITOR : But the right thing, Theaetetus, is still to take imitation to have
two parts. Think about why.
THEAETETUS : Tell me.
VISITOR : Some imitators know what they’re imitating and some don’t.
And what division is more important than the one between ignorance
and knowledge?
THEAETETUS : None.
VISITOR : Wasn’t the imitation that we just mentioned the kind that’s
associated with knowledge? Someone who knew you and your character
might imitate you, mightn’t he?
THEAETETUS : Of course. c
VISITOR : What about the character of justice and all of virtue taken to-
gether? Don’t many people who are ignorant of it, but have some beliefs
about it, try hard to cause what they believe it is to appear to be present
in them. And don’t they imitate it in their words and actions as much as
they can?
THEAETETUS : Very many people do that.292 Sophist
VISITOR : And are they all unsuccessful at seeming to be just without
being just at all? Or is the opposite true?
THEAETETUS : Yes, the opposite.
VISITOR : I think we have to say that this person, who doesn’t know, is d
a very different imitator from the previous one, who does.
THEAETETUS : Yes.
VISITOR : Where would you get a suitable name for each of them? Isn’t
it obviously hard to, just because the people who came before us were
thoughtless and lazy about dividing kinds into types, and so they never
even tried to divide them. That’s why we necessarily lack a good supply
of names. Still, even though it sounds daring let’s distinguish them by
calling imitation accompanied by belief “belief-mimicry” and imitation e
accompanied by knowledge “informed mimicry.”
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : Then we need to use the former term, since the sophist isn’t
one of the people who know but is one of the people who imitate.
THEAETETUS : He certainly is.
VISITOR : Let’s examine the belief-mimic the way people examine iron,
to see whether it’s sound or has a crack in it.
THEAETETUS : All right.
VISITOR : Well, it has a big one. One sort of belief-mimic is foolish and 268
thinks he knows the things he only has beliefs about. The other sort has
been around a lot of discussions, and so by temperament he’s suspicious
and fearful that he doesn’t know the things that he pretends in front of
others to know.
THEAETETUS : There deﬁnitely are both types that you’ve mentioned.
VISITOR : Shall we take one of these to be a sort of sincere imitator and
the other to be an insincere one?
THEAETETUS : That seems right.
VISITOR : And are there one or two kinds of insincere ones?
THEAETETUS : You look and see.
VISITOR : I’m looking, and there clearly appear to be two. I see that one b
sort can maintain his insincerity in long speeches to a crowd, and the other
uses short speeches in private conversation to force the person talking
with him to contradict himself.
THEAETETUS : You’re absolutely right.
VISITOR : How shall we show up the long-winded sort, as a statesman
or as a demagogue?
THEAETETUS : A demagogue.
VISITOR : And what shall we call the other one? Wise, or a sophist?
THEAETETUS : We can’t call him wise, since we took him not to know
anything. But since he imitates the wise man he’ll obviously have a name c
derived from the wise man’s name. And now at last I see that we have
to call him the person who is really and truly a sophist.Sophist 293
VISITOR : Shall we weave his name together from start to ﬁnish and tie
it up the way we did before?
THEAETETUS : Of course.
VISITOR : Imitation of the contrary-speech-producing, insincere and un-
knowing sort, of the appearance-making kind of copy-making, the word-
juggling part of production that’s marked off as human and not divine. 268d
Anyone who says the sophist is of this “blood and family”30will be saying,
it seems, the complete truth.
THEAETETUS : Absolutely.`;

BOOK ONE
Part I
Every state is a community of some kind, and every community is established with a view to some good; for mankind always act in order to
obtain that which they think good. But, if all communities aim at some
good, the state or political community, which is the highest of all, and
which embraces all the rest, aims at good in a greater degree than any
other, and at the highest good.
Some people think that the qualifications of a statesman, king, householder, and master are the same, and that they differ, not in kind, but
only in the number of their subjects. For example, the ruler over a few is
called a master; over more, the manager of a household; over a still
larger number, a statesman or king, as if there were no difference between a great household and a small state. The distinction which is made
between the king and the statesman is as follows: When the government
is personal, the ruler is a king; when, according to the rules of the political science, the citizens rule and are ruled in turn, then he is called a
statesman.
But all this is a mistake; for governments differ in kind, as will be
evident to any one who considers the matter according to the method
which has hitherto guided us. As in other departments of science, so in
politics, the compound should always be resolved into the simple elements or least parts of the whole. We must therefore look at the elements
of which the state is composed, in order that we may see in what the
different kinds of rule differ from one another, and whether any scientific result can be attained about each one of them.
4/Aristotle
Part II
He who thus considers things in their first growth and origin, whether a
state or anything else, will obtain the clearest view of them. In the first
place there must be a union of those who cannot exist without each
other; namely, of male and female, that the race may continue (and this
is a union which is formed, not of deliberate purpose, but because, in
common with other animals and with plants, mankind have a natural
desire to leave behind them an image of themselves), and of natural
ruler and subject, that both may be preserved. For that which can foresee by the exercise of mind is by nature intended to be lord and master,
and that which can with its body give effect to such foresight is a subject, and by nature a slave; hence master and slave have the same interest. Now nature has distinguished between the female and the slave. For
she is not niggardly, like the smith who fashions the Delphian knife for
many uses; she makes each thing for a single use, and every instrument
is best made when intended for one and not for many uses. But among
barbarians no distinction is made between women and slaves, because
there is no natural ruler among them: they are a community of slaves,
male and female. Wherefore the poets say,
“It is meet that Hellenes should rule over barbarians;”
as if they thought that the barbarian and the slave were by nature one.
Out of these two relationships between man and woman, master
and slave, the first thing to arise is the family, and Hesiod is right when
he says,
“First house and wife and an ox for the plough,”
for the ox is the poor man’s slave. The family is the association established by nature for the supply of men’s everyday wants, and the members of it are called by Charondas ‘companions of the cupboard,’ and
by Epimenides the Cretan, ‘companions of the manger.’ But when several families are united, and the association aims at something more
than the supply of daily needs, the first society to be formed is the village. And the most natural form of the village appears to be that of a
colony from the family, composed of the children and grandchildren,
who are said to be suckled ‘with the same milk.’ And this is the reason
why Hellenic states were originally governed by kings; because the
Politics/5
Hellenes were under royal rule before they came together, as the barbarians still are. Every family is ruled by the eldest, and therefore in the
colonies of the family the kingly form of government prevailed because
they were of the same blood. As Homer says:
“Each one gives law to his children and to his wives.”
For they lived dispersedly, as was the manner in ancient times.
Wherefore men say that the Gods have a king, because they themselves
either are or were in ancient times under the rule of a king. For they
imagine, not only the forms of the Gods, but their ways of life to be like
their own.
When several villages are united in a single complete community,
large enough to be nearly or quite self-sufficing, the state comes into
existence, originating in the bare needs of life, and continuing in existence for the sake of a good life. And therefore, if the earlier forms of
society are natural, so is the state, for it is the end of them, and the
nature of a thing is its end. For what each thing is when fully developed,
we call its nature, whether we are speaking of a man, a horse, or a
family. Besides, the final cause and end of a thing is the best, and to be
self-sufficing is the end and the best.
Hence it is evident that the state is a creation of nature, and that man
is by nature a political animal. And he who by nature and not by mere
accident is without a state, is either a bad man or above humanity; he is
like the
“Tribeless, lawless, hearthless one,”
whom Homer denounces—the natural outcast is forthwith a lover of
war; he may be compared to an isolated piece at draughts.
Now, that man is more of a political animal than bees or any other
gregarious animals is evident. Nature, as we often say, makes nothing in
vain, and man is the only animal whom she has endowed with the gift of
speech. And whereas mere voice is but an indication of pleasure or pain,
and is therefore found in other animals (for their nature attains to the
perception of pleasure and pain and the intimation of them to one another, and no further), the power of speech is intended to set forth the
expedient and inexpedient, and therefore likewise the just and the unjust. And it is a characteristic of man that he alone has any sense of
6/Aristotle
good and evil, of just and unjust, and the like, and the association of
living beings who have this sense makes a family and a state.
Further, the state is by nature clearly prior to the family and to the
individual, since the whole is of necessity prior to the part; for example,
if the whole body be destroyed, there will be no foot or hand, except in
an equivocal sense, as we might speak of a stone hand; for when destroyed the hand will be no better than that. But things are defined by
their working and power; and we ought not to say that they are the same
when they no longer have their proper quality, but only that they have
the same name. The proof that the state is a creation of nature and prior
to the individual is that the individual, when isolated, is not self-sufficing; and therefore he is like a part in relation to the whole. But he who is
unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for
himself, must be either a beast or a god: he is no part of a state. A social
instinct is implanted in all men by nature, and yet he who first founded
the state was the greatest of benefactors. For man, when perfected, is
the best of animals, but, when separated from law and justice, he is the
worst of all; since armed injustice is the more dangerous, and he is
equipped at birth with arms, meant to be used by intelligence and virtue,
which he may use for the worst ends. Wherefore, if he have not virtue,
he is the most unholy and the most savage of animals, and the most full
of lust and gluttony. But justice is the bond of men in states, for the
administration of justice, which is the determination of what is just, is
the principle of order in political society.
Part III
Seeing then that the state is made up of households, before speaking of
the state we must speak of the management of the household. The parts
of household management correspond to the persons who compose the
household, and a complete household consists of slaves and freemen.
Now we should begin by examining everything in its fewest possible
elements; and the first and fewest possible parts of a family are master
and slave, husband and wife, father and children. We have therefore to
consider what each of these three relations is and ought to be: I mean the
relation of master and servant, the marriage relation (the conjunction of
man and wife has no name of its own), and thirdly, the procreative relation (this also has no proper name). And there is another element of a
household, the so-called art of getting wealth, which, according to some,
is identical with household management, according to others, a princi-
Politics/7
pal part of it; the nature of this art will also have to be considered by us.
Let us first speak of master and slave, looking to the needs of practical life and also seeking to attain some better theory of their relation
than exists at present. For some are of opinion that the rule of a master
is a science, and that the management of a household, and the mastership of slaves, and the political and royal rule, as I was saying at the
outset, are all the same. Others affirm that the rule of a master over
slaves is contrary to nature, and that the distinction between slave and
freeman exists by law only, and not by nature; and being an interference
with nature is therefore unjust.
Part IV
Property is a part of the household, and the art of acquiring property is
a part of the art of managing the household; for no man can live well, or
indeed live at all, unless he be provided with necessaries. And as in the
arts which have a definite sphere the workers must have their own proper
instruments for the accomplishment of their work, so it is in the management of a household. Now instruments are of various sorts; some are
living, others lifeless; in the rudder, the pilot of a ship has a lifeless, in
the look-out man, a living instrument; for in the arts the servant is a kind
of instrument. Thus, too, a possession is an instrument for maintaining
life. And so, in the arrangement of the family, a slave is a living possession, and property a number of such instruments; and the servant is
himself an instrument which takes precedence of all other instruments.
For if every instrument could accomplish its own work, obeying or anticipating the will of others, like the statues of Daedalus, or the tripods
of Hephaestus, which, says the poet,
“of their own accord entered the assembly of the Gods;”
if, in like manner, the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the
lyre without a hand to guide them, chief workmen would not want servants, nor masters slaves. Here, however, another distinction must be
drawn; the instruments commonly so called are instruments of production, whilst a possession is an instrument of action. The shuttle, for
example, is not only of use; but something else is made by it, whereas of
a garment or of a bed there is only the use. Further, as production and
action are different in kind, and both require instruments, the instruments which they employ must likewise differ in kind. But life is action
8/Aristotle
and not production, and therefore the slave is the minister of action.
Again, a possession is spoken of as a part is spoken of; for the part is
not only a part of something else, but wholly belongs to it; and this is
also true of a possession. The master is only the master of the slave; he
does not belong to him, whereas the slave is not only the slave of his
master, but wholly belongs to him. Hence we see what is the nature and
office of a slave; he who is by nature not his own but another’s man, is
by nature a slave; and he may be said to be another’s man who, being a
human being, is also a possession. And a possession may be defined as
an instrument of action, separable from the possessor.
Part V
But is there any one thus intended by nature to be a slave, and for whom
such a condition is expedient and right, or rather is not all slavery a
violation of nature?
There is no difficulty in answering this question, on grounds both of
reason and of fact. For that some should rule and others be ruled is a
thing not only necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth,
some are marked out for subjection, others for rule.
And there are many kinds both of rulers and subjects (and that rule
is the better which is exercised over better subjects—for example, to
rule over men is better than to rule over wild beasts; for the work is
better which is executed by better workmen, and where one man rules
and another is ruled, they may be said to have a work); for in all things
which form a composite whole and which are made up of parts, whether
continuous or discrete, a distinction between the ruling and the subject
element comes to fight. Such a duality exists in living creatures, but not
in them only; it originates in the constitution of the universe; even in
things which have no life there is a ruling principle, as in a musical
mode. But we are wandering from the subject. We will therefore restrict
ourselves to the living creature, which, in the first place, consists of soul
and body: and of these two, the one is by nature the ruler, and the other
the subject. But then we must look for the intentions of nature in things
which retain their nature, and not in things which are corrupted. And
therefore we must study the man who is in the most perfect state both of
body and soul, for in him we shall see the true relation of the two;
although in bad or corrupted natures the body will often appear to rule
over the soul, because they are in an evil and unnatural condition. At all
events we may firstly observe in living creatures both a despotical and a
Politics/9
constitutional rule; for the soul rules the body with a despotical rule,
whereas the intellect rules the appetites with a constitutional and royal
rule. And it is clear that the rule of the soul over the body, and of the
mind and the rational element over the passionate, is natural and expedient; whereas the equality of the two or the rule of the inferior is always
hurtful. The same holds good of animals in relation to men; for tame
animals have a better nature than wild, and all tame animals are better
off when they are ruled by man; for then they are preserved. Again, the
male is by nature superior, and the female inferior; and the one rules,
and the other is ruled; this principle, of necessity, extends to all mankind.
Where then there is such a difference as that between soul and body,
or between men and animals (as in the case of those whose business is to
use their body, and who can do nothing better), the lower sort are by
nature slaves, and it is better for them as for all inferiors that they should
be under the rule of a master. For he who can be, and therefore is,
another’s and he who participates in rational principle enough to apprehend, but not to have, such a principle, is a slave by nature. Whereas the
lower animals cannot even apprehend a principle; they obey their instincts. And indeed the use made of slaves and of tame animals is not
very different; for both with their bodies minister to the needs of life.
Nature would like to distinguish between the bodies of freemen and
slaves, making the one strong for servile labor, the other upright, and
although useless for such services, useful for political life in the arts
both of war and peace. But the opposite often happens—that some have
the souls and others have the bodies of freemen. And doubtless if men
differed from one another in the mere forms of their bodies as much as
the statues of the Gods do from men, all would acknowledge that the
inferior class should be slaves of the superior. And if this is true of the
body, how much more just that a similar distinction should exist in the
soul? but the beauty of the body is seen, whereas the beauty of the soul
is not seen. It is clear, then, that some men are by nature free, and others
slaves, and that for these latter slavery is both expedient and right.
Part VI
But that those who take the opposite view have in a certain way right on
their side, may be easily seen. For the words slavery and slave are used
in two senses. There is a slave or slavery by law as well as by nature.
The law of which I speak is a sort of convention—the law by which
10/Aristotle
whatever is taken in war is supposed to belong to the victors. But this
right many jurists impeach, as they would an orator who brought forward an unconstitutional measure: they detest the notion that, because
one man has the power of doing violence and is superior in brute strength,
another shall be his slave and subject. Even among philosophers there is
a difference of opinion. The origin of the dispute, and what makes the
views invade each other’s territory, is as follows: in some sense virtue,
when furnished with means, has actually the greatest power of exercising force; and as superior power is only found where there is superior
excellence of some kind, power seems to imply virtue, and the dispute to
be simply one about justice (for it is due to one party identifying justice
with goodwill while the other identifies it with the mere rule of the stronger). If these views are thus set out separately, the other views have no
force or plausibility against the view that the superior in virtue ought to
rule, or be master. Others, clinging, as they think, simply to a principle
of justice (for law and custom are a sort of justice), assume that slavery
in accordance with the custom of war is justified by law, but at the same
moment they deny this. For what if the cause of the war be unjust? And
again, no one would ever say he is a slave who is unworthy to be a slave.
Were this the case, men of the highest rank would be slaves and the
children of slaves if they or their parents chance to have been taken
captive and sold. Wherefore Hellenes do not like to call Hellenes slaves,
but confine the term to barbarians. Yet, in using this language, they
really mean the natural slave of whom we spoke at first; for it must be
admitted that some are slaves everywhere, others nowhere. The same
principle applies to nobility. Hellenes regard themselves as noble everywhere, and not only in their own country, but they deem the barbarians
noble only when at home, thereby implying that there are two sorts of
nobility and freedom, the one absolute, the other relative. The Helen of
Theodectes says:
“Who would presume to call me servant who am on both sides sprung
from the stem of the Gods?”
What does this mean but that they distinguish freedom and slavery,
noble and humble birth, by the two principles of good and evil? They
think that as men and animals beget men and animals, so from good men
a good man springs. But this is what nature, though she may intend it,
cannot always accomplish.
Politics/11
We see then that there is some foundation for this difference of opinion, and that all are not either slaves by nature or freemen by nature, and
also that there is in some cases a marked distinction between the two
classes, rendering it expedient and right for the one to be slaves and the
others to be masters: the one practicing obedience, the others exercising
the authority and lordship which nature intended them to have. The abuse
of this authority is injurious to both; for the interests of part and whole,
of body and soul, are the same, and the slave is a part of the master, a
living but separated part of his bodily frame. Hence, where the relation
of master and slave between them is natural they are friends and have a
common interest, but where it rests merely on law and force the reverse
is true.
Part VII
The previous remarks are quite enough to show that the rule of a
master is not a constitutional rule, and that all the different kinds of rule
are not, as some affirm, the same with each other. For there is one rule
exercised over subjects who are by nature free, another over subjects
who are by nature slaves. The rule of a household is a monarchy, for
every house is under one head: whereas constitutional rule is a government of freemen and equals. The master is not called a master because
he has science, but because he is of a certain character, and the same
remark applies to the slave and the freeman. Still there may be a science
for the master and science for the slave. The science of the slave would
be such as the man of Syracuse taught, who made money by instructing
slaves in their ordinary duties. And such a knowledge may be carried
further, so as to include cookery and similar menial arts. For some duties are of the more necessary, others of the more honorable sort; as the
proverb says, ‘slave before slave, master before master.’ But all such
branches of knowledge are servile. There is likewise a science of the
master, which teaches the use of slaves; for the master as such is concerned, not with the acquisition, but with the use of them. Yet this socalled science is not anything great or wonderful; for the master need
only know how to order that which the slave must know how to execute.
Hence those who are in a position which places them above toil have
stewards who attend to their households while they occupy themselves
with philosophy or with politics. But the art of acquiring slaves, I mean
of justly acquiring them, differs both from the art of the master and the
art of the slave, being a species of hunting or war. Enough of the distinc-
12/Aristotle
tion between master and slave.
Part VIII
Let us now inquire into property generally, and into the art of getting
wealth, in accordance with our usual method, for a slave has been shown
to be a part of property. The first question is whether the art of getting
wealth is the same with the art of managing a household or a part of it,
or instrumental to it; and if the last, whether in the way that the art of
making shuttles is instrumental to the art of weaving, or in the way that
the casting of bronze is instrumental to the art of the statuary, for they
are not instrumental in the same way, but the one provides tools and the
other material; and by material I mean the substratum out of which any
work is made; thus wool is the material of the weaver, bronze of the
statuary. Now it is easy to see that the art of household management is
not identical with the art of getting wealth, for the one uses the material
which the other provides. For the art which uses household stores can
be no other than the art of household management. There is, however, a
doubt whether the art of getting wealth is a part of household management or a distinct art. If the getter of wealth has to consider whence
wealth and property can be procured, but there are many sorts of property and riches, then are husbandry, and the care and provision of food
in general, parts of the wealth-getting art or distinct arts? Again, there
are many sorts of food, and therefore there are many kinds of lives both
of animals and men; they must all have food, and the differences in their
food have made differences in their ways of life. For of beasts, some are
gregarious, others are solitary; they live in the way which is best adapted
to sustain them, accordingly as they are carnivorous or herbivorous or
omnivorous: and their habits are determined for them by nature in such
a manner that they may obtain with greater facility the food of their
choice. But, as different species have different tastes, the same things
are not naturally pleasant to all of them; and therefore the lives of carnivorous or herbivorous animals further differ among themselves. In the
lives of men too there is a great difference. The laziest are shepherds,
who lead an idle life, and get their subsistence without trouble from
tame animals; their flocks having to wander from place to place in search
of pasture, they are compelled to follow them, cultivating a sort of living farm. Others support themselves by hunting, which is of different
kinds. Some, for example, are brigands, others, who dwell near lakes or
marshes or rivers or a sea in which there are fish, are fishermen, and
Politics/13
others live by the pursuit of birds or wild beasts. The greater number
obtain a living from the cultivated fruits of the soil. Such are the modes
of subsistence which prevail among those whose industry springs up of
itself, and whose food is not acquired by exchange and retail trade—
there is the shepherd, the husbandman, the brigand, the fisherman, the
hunter. Some gain a comfortable maintenance out of two employments,
eking out the deficiencies of one of them by another: thus the life of a
shepherd may be combined with that of a brigand, the life of a farmer
with that of a hunter. Other modes of life are similarly combined in any
way which the needs of men may require. Property, in the sense of a
bare livelihood, seems to be given by nature herself to all, both when
they are first born, and when they are grown up. For some animals bring
forth, together with their offspring, so much food as will last until they
are able to supply themselves; of this the vermiparous or oviparous
animals are an instance; and the viviparous animals have up to a certain
time a supply of food for their young in themselves, which is called
milk. In like manner we may infer that, after the birth of animals, plants
exist for their sake, and that the other animals exist for the sake of man,
the tame for use and food, the wild, if not all at least the greater part of
them, for food, and for the provision of clothing and various instruments. Now if nature makes nothing incomplete, and nothing in vain,
the inference must be that she has made all animals for the sake of man.
And so, in one point of view, the art of war is a natural art of acquisition, for the art of acquisition includes hunting, an art which we ought
to practice against wild beasts, and against men who, though intended
by nature to be governed, will not submit; for war of such a kind is
naturally just.
Of the art of acquisition then there is one kind which by nature is a
part of the management of a household, in so far as the art of household
management must either find ready to hand, or itself provide, such things
necessary to life, and useful for the community of the family or state, as
can be stored. They are the elements of true riches; for the amount of
property which is needed for a good life is not unlimited, although Solon
in one of his poems says that
“No bound to riches has been fixed for man.”
But there is a boundary fixed, just as there is in the other arts; for
the instruments of any art are never unlimited, either in number or size,
14/Aristotle
and riches may be defined as a number of instruments to be used in a
household or in a state. And so we see that there is a natural art of
acquisition which is practiced by managers of households and by statesmen, and what is the reason of this.
Part IX
There is another variety of the art of acquisition which is commonly and
rightly called an art of wealth-getting, and has in fact suggested the
notion that riches and property have no limit. Being nearly connected
with the preceding, it is often identified with it. But though they are not
very different, neither are they the same. The kind already described is
given by nature, the other is gained by experience and art.
Let us begin our discussion of the question with the following considerations:
Of everything which we possess there are two uses: both belong to
the thing as such, but not in the same manner, for one is the proper, and
the other the improper or secondary use of it. For example, a shoe is
used for wear, and is used for exchange; both are uses of the shoe. He
who gives a shoe in exchange for money or food to him who wants one,
does indeed use the shoe as a shoe, but this is not its proper or primary
purpose, for a shoe is not made to be an object of barter. The same may
be said of all possessions, for the art of exchange extends to all of them,
and it arises at first from what is natural, from the circumstance that
some have too little, others too much. Hence we may infer that retail
trade is not a natural part of the art of getting wealth; had it been so,
men would have ceased to exchange when they had enough. In the first
community, indeed, which is the family, this art is obviously of no use,
but it begins to be useful when the society increases. For the members of
the family originally had all things in common; later, when the family
divided into parts, the parts shared in many things, and different parts in
different things, which they had to give in exchange for what they wanted,
a kind of barter which is still practiced among barbarous nations who
exchange with one another the necessaries of life and nothing more;
giving and receiving wine, for example, in exchange for coin, and the
like. This sort of barter is not part of the wealth-getting art and is not
contrary to nature, but is needed for the satisfaction of men’s natural
wants. The other or more complex form of exchange grew, as might
have been inferred, out of the simpler. When the inhabitants of one country
became more dependent on those of another, and they imported what
Politics/15
they needed, and exported what they had too much of, money necessarily came into use. For the various necessaries of life are not easily carried about, and hence men agreed to employ in their dealings with each
other something which was intrinsically useful and easily applicable to
the purposes of life, for example, iron, silver, and the like. Of this the
value was at first measured simply by size and weight, but in process of
time they put a stamp upon it, to save the trouble of weighing and to
mark the value.
When the use of coin had once been discovered, out of the barter of
necessary articles arose the other art of wealth getting, namely, retail
trade; which was at first probably a simple matter, but became more
complicated as soon as men learned by experience whence and by what
exchanges the greatest profit might be made. Originating in the use of
coin, the art of getting wealth is generally thought to be chiefly concerned with it, and to be the art which produces riches and wealth; having to consider how they may be accumulated. Indeed, riches is assumed by many to be only a quantity of coin, because the arts of getting
wealth and retail trade are concerned with coin. Others maintain that
coined money is a mere sham, a thing not natural, but conventional
only, because, if the users substitute another commodity for it, it is worthless, and because it is not useful as a means to any of the necessities of
life, and, indeed, he who is rich in coin may often be in want of necessary food. But how can that be wealth of which a man may have a great
abundance and yet perish with hunger, like Midas in the fable, whose
insatiable prayer turned everything that was set before him into gold?
Hence men seek after a better notion of riches and of the art of
getting wealth than the mere acquisition of coin, and they are right. For
natural riches and the natural art of wealth-getting are a different thing;
in their true form they are part of the management of a household; whereas
retail trade is the art of producing wealth, not in every way, but by
exchange. And it is thought to be concerned with coin; for coin is the
unit of exchange and the measure or limit of it. And there is no bound to
the riches which spring from this art of wealth getting. As in the art of
medicine there is no limit to the pursuit of health, and as in the other arts
there is no limit to the pursuit of their several ends, for they aim at
accomplishing their ends to the uttermost (but of the means there is a
limit, for the end is always the limit), so, too, in this art of wealthgetting there is no limit of the end, which is riches of the spurious kind,
and the acquisition of wealth. But the art of wealth-getting which con-
16/Aristotle
sists in household management, on the other hand, has a limit; the unlimited acquisition of wealth is not its business. And, therefore, in one
point of view, all riches must have a limit; nevertheless, as a matter of
fact, we find the opposite to be the case; for all getters of wealth increase their hoard of coin without limit. The source of the confusion is
the near connection between the two kinds of wealth-getting; in either,
the instrument is the same, although the use is different, and so they
pass into one another; for each is a use of the same property, but with a
difference: accumulation is the end in the one case, but there is a further
end in the other. Hence some persons are led to believe that getting
wealth is the object of household management, and the whole idea of
their lives is that they ought either to increase their money without limit,
or at any rate not to lose it. The origin of this disposition in men is that
they are intent upon living only, and not upon living well; and, as their
desires are unlimited they also desire that the means of gratifying them
should be without limit. Those who do aim at a good life seek the means
of obtaining bodily pleasures; and, since the enjoyment of these appears
to depend on property, they are absorbed in getting wealth: and so there
arises the second species of wealth-getting. For, as their enjoyment is in
excess, they seek an art which produces the excess of enjoyment; and, if
they are not able to supply their pleasures by the art of getting wealth,
they try other arts, using in turn every faculty in a manner contrary to
nature. The quality of courage, for example, is not intended to make
wealth, but to inspire confidence; neither is this the aim of the general’s
or of the physician’s art; but the one aims at victory and the other at
health. Nevertheless, some men turn every quality or art into a means of
getting wealth; this they conceive to be the end, and to the promotion of
the end they think all things must contribute.
Thus, then, we have considered the art of wealth-getting which is
unnecessary, and why men want it; and also the necessary art of wealthgetting, which we have seen to be different from the other, and to be a
natural part of the art of managing a household, concerned with the
provision of food, not, however, like the former kind, unlimited, but
having a limit.
Part X
And we have found the answer to our original question, Whether the art
of getting wealth is the business of the manager of a household and of
the statesman or not their business? viz., that wealth is presupposed by
Politics/17
them. For as political science does not make men, but takes them from
nature and uses them, so too nature provides them with earth or sea or
the like as a source of food. At this stage begins the duty of the manager
of a household, who has to order the things which nature supplies; he
may be compared to the weaver who has not to make but to use wool,
and to know, too, what sort of wool is good and serviceable or bad and
unserviceable. Were this otherwise, it would be difficult to see why the
art of getting wealth is a part of the management of a household and the
art of medicine not; for surely the members of a household must have
health just as they must have life or any other necessary. The answer is
that as from one point of view the master of the house and the ruler of
the state have to consider about health, from another point of view not
they but the physician; so in one way the art of household management,
in another way the subordinate art, has to consider about wealth. But,
strictly speaking, as I have already said, the means of life must be provided beforehand by nature; for the business of nature is to furnish food
to that which is born, and the food of the offspring is always what remains over of that from which it is produced. Wherefore the art of getting wealth out of fruits and animals is always natural.
There are two sorts of wealth-getting, as I have said; one is a part of
household management, the other is retail trade: the former necessary
and honorable, while that which consists in exchange is justly censured;
for it is unnatural, and a mode by which men gain from one another. The
most hated sort, and with the greatest reason, is usury, which makes a
gain out of money itself, and not from the natural object of it. For money
was intended to be used in exchange, but not to increase at interest. And
this term interest, which means the birth of money from money, is applied to the breeding of money because the offspring resembles the parent. Wherefore of an modes of getting wealth this is the most unnatural.
Part XI
Enough has been said about the theory of wealth-getting; we will now
proceed to the practical part. The discussion of such matters is not unworthy of philosophy, but to be engaged in them practically is illiberal
and irksome. The useful parts of wealth-getting are, first, the knowledge of livestock—which are most profitable, and where, and how—as,
for example, what sort of horses or sheep or oxen or any other animals
are most likely to give a return. A man ought to know which of these
pay better than others, and which pay best in particular places, for some
18/Aristotle
do better in one place and some in another. Secondly, husbandry, which
may be either tillage or planting, and the keeping of bees and of fish, or
fowl, or of any animals which may be useful to man. These are the
divisions of the true or proper art of wealth-getting and come first. Of
the other, which consists in exchange, the first and most important division is commerce (of which there are three kinds—the provision of a
ship, the conveyance of goods, exposure for sale—these again differing
as they are safer or more profitable), the second is usury, the third,
service for hire—of this, one kind is employed in the mechanical arts,
the other in unskilled and bodily labor. There is still a third sort of wealth
getting intermediate between this and the first or natural mode which is
partly natural, but is also concerned with exchange, viz., the industries
that make their profit from the earth, and from things growing from the
earth which, although they bear no fruit, are nevertheless profitable; for
example, the cutting of timber and all mining. The art of mining, by
which minerals are obtained, itself has many branches, for there are
various kinds of things dug out of the earth. Of the several divisions of
wealth-getting I now speak generally; a minute consideration of them
might be useful in practice, but it would be tiresome to dwell upon them
at greater length now.
Those occupations are most truly arts in which there is the least
element of chance; they are the meanest in which the body is most deteriorated, the most servile in which there is the greatest use of the body,
and the most illiberal in which there is the least need of excellence.
Works have been written upon these subjects by various persons;
for example, by Chares the Parian, and Apollodorus the Lemnian, who
have treated of Tillage and Planting, while others have treated of other
branches; any one who cares for such matters may refer to their writings. It would be well also to collect the scattered stories of the ways in
which individuals have succeeded in amassing a fortune; for all this is
useful to persons who value the art of getting wealth. There is the anecdote of Thales the Milesian and his financial device, which involves a
principle of universal application, but is attributed to him on account of
his reputation for wisdom. He was reproached for his poverty, which
was supposed to show that philosophy was of no use. According to the
story, he knew by his skill in the stars while it was yet winter that there
would be a great harvest of olives in the coming year; so, having a little
money, he gave deposits for the use of all the olive-presses in Chios and
Miletus, which he hired at a low price because no one bid against him.
Politics/19
When the harvest-time came, and many were wanted all at once and of
a sudden, he let them out at any rate which he pleased, and made a
quantity of money. Thus he showed the world that philosophers can
easily be rich if they like, but that their ambition is of another sort. He is
supposed to have given a striking proof of his wisdom, but, as I was
saying, his device for getting wealth is of universal application, and is
nothing but the creation of a monopoly. It is an art often practiced by
cities when they are want of money; they make a monopoly of provisions.
There was a man of Sicily, who, having money deposited with him,
bought up an the iron from the iron mines; afterwards, when the merchants from their various markets came to buy, he was the only seller,
and without much increasing the price he gained 200 per cent. Which
when Dionysius heard, he told him that he might take away his money,
but that he must not remain at Syracuse, for he thought that the man had
discovered a way of making money which was injurious to his own
interests. He made the same discovery as Thales; they both contrived to
create a monopoly for themselves. And statesmen as well ought to know
these things; for a state is often as much in want of money and of such
devices for obtaining it as a household, or even more so; hence some
public men devote themselves entirely to finance.
Part XII
Of household management we have seen that there are three parts—one
is the rule of a master over slaves, which has been discussed already,
another of a father, and the third of a husband. A husband and father,
we saw, rules over wife and children, both free, but the rule differs, the
rule over his children being a royal, over his wife a constitutional rule.
For although there may be exceptions to the order of nature, the male is
by nature fitter for command than the female, just as the elder and fullgrown is superior to the younger and more immature. But in most constitutional states the citizens rule and are ruled by turns, for the idea of
a constitutional state implies that the natures of the citizens are equal,
and do not differ at all. Nevertheless, when one rules and the other is
ruled we endeavor to create a difference of outward forms and names
and titles of respect, which may be illustrated by the saying of Amasis
about his foot-pan. The relation of the male to the female is of this kind,
but there the inequality is permanent. The rule of a father over his children is royal, for he rules by virtue both of love and of the respect due to
20/Aristotle
age, exercising a kind of royal power. And therefore Homer has appropriately called Zeus ‘father of Gods and men,’ because he is the king of
them all. For a king is the natural superior of his subjects, but he should
be of the same kin or kind with them, and such is the relation of elder
and younger, of father and son.
Part XIII
Thus it is clear that household management attends more to men than to
the acquisition of inanimate things, and to human excellence more than
to the excellence of property which we call wealth, and to the virtue of
freemen more than to the virtue of slaves. A question may indeed be
raised, whether there is any excellence at all in a slave beyond and higher
than merely instrumental and ministerial qualities—whether he can have
the virtues of temperance, courage, justice, and the like; or whether
slaves possess only bodily and ministerial qualities. And, whichever
way we answer the question, a difficulty arises; for, if they have virtue,
in what will they differ from freemen? On the other hand, since they are
men and share in rational principle, it seems absurd to say that they
have no virtue. A similar question may be raised about women and
children, whether they too have virtues: ought a woman to be temperate
and brave and just, and is a child to be called temperate, and intemperate, or note So in general we may ask about the natural ruler, and the
natural subject, whether they have the same or different virtues. For if a
noble nature is equally required in both, why should one of them always
rule, and the other always be ruled? Nor can we say that this is a question of degree, for the difference between ruler and subject is a difference of kind, which the difference of more and less never is. Yet how
strange is the supposition that the one ought, and that the other ought
not, to have virtue! For if the ruler is intemperate and unjust, how can he
rule well? If the subject, how can he obey well? If he be licentious and
cowardly, he will certainly not do his duty. It is evident, therefore, that
both of them must have a share of virtue, but varying as natural subjects
also vary among themselves. Here the very constitution of the soul has
shown us the way; in it one part naturally rules, and the other is subject,
and the virtue of the ruler we in maintain to be different from that of the
subject; the one being the virtue of the rational, and the other of the
irrational part. Now, it is obvious that the same principle applies generally, and therefore almost all things rule and are ruled according to nature. But the kind of rule differs; the freeman rules over the slave after
Politics/21
another manner from that in which the male rules over the female, or the
man over the child; although the parts of the soul are present in an of
them, they are present in different degrees. For the slave has no deliberative faculty at all; the woman has, but it is without authority, and the
child has, but it is immature. So it must necessarily be supposed to be
with the moral virtues also; all should partake of them, but only in such
manner and degree as is required by each for the fulfillment of his duty.
Hence the ruler ought to have moral virtue in perfection, for his function, taken absolutely, demands a master artificer, and rational principle
is such an artificer; the subjects, oil the other hand, require only that
measure of virtue which is proper to each of them. Clearly, then, moral
virtue belongs to all of them; but the temperance of a man and of a
woman, or the courage and justice of a man and of a woman, are not, as
Socrates maintained, the same; the courage of a man is shown in commanding, of a woman in obeying. And this holds of all other virtues, as
will be more clearly seen if we look at them in detail, for those who say
generally that virtue consists in a good disposition of the soul, or in
doing rightly, or the like, only deceive themselves. Far better than such
definitions is their mode of speaking, who, like Gorgias, enumerate the
virtues. All classes must be deemed to have their special attributes; as
the poet says of women,
“Silence is a woman’s glory,”
but this is not equally the glory of man. The child is imperfect, and
therefore obviously his virtue is not relative to himself alone, but to the
perfect man and to his teacher, and in like manner the virtue of the slave
is relative to a master. Now we determined that a slave is useful for the
wants of life, and therefore he will obviously require only so much virtue as will prevent him from failing in his duty through cowardice or
lack of self-control. Some one will ask whether, if what we are saying is
true, virtue will not be required also in the artisans, for they often fail in
their work through the lack of self control? But is there not a great
difference in the two cases? For the slave shares in his master’s life; the
artisan is less closely connected with him, and only attains excellence in
proportion as he becomes a slave. The meaner sort of mechanic has a
special and separate slavery; and whereas the slave exists by nature, not
so the shoemaker or other artisan. It is manifest, then, that the master
ought to be the source of such excellence in the slave, and not a mere
22/Aristotle
possessor of the art of mastership which trains the slave in his duties.
Wherefore they are mistaken who forbid us to converse with slaves and
say that we should employ command only, for slaves stand even more in
need of admonition than children.
So much for this subject; the relations of husband and wife, parent
and child, their several virtues, what in their intercourse with one another is good, and what is evil, and how we may pursue the good and
good and escape the evil, will have to be discussed when we speak of the
different forms of government. For, inasmuch as every family is a part
of a state, and these relationships are the parts of a family, and the virtue
of the part must have regard to the virtue of the whole, women and
children must be trained by education with an eye to the constitution, if
the virtues of either of them are supposed to make any difference in the
virtues of the state. And they must make a difference: for the children
grow up to be citizens, and half the free persons in a state are women.
Of these matters, enough has been said; of what remains, let us
speak at another time. Regarding, then, our present inquiry as complete,
we will make a new beginning. And, first, let us examine the various
theories of a perfect state.
BOOK TWO
Part I
Our purpose is to consider what form of political community is best of
all for those who are most able to realize their ideal of life. We must
therefore examine not only this but other constitutions, both such as
actually exist in well-governed states, and any theoretical forms which
are held in esteem; that what is good and useful may be brought to light.
And let no one suppose that in seeking for something beyond them we
are anxious to make a sophistical display at any cost; we only undertake
this inquiry because all the constitutions with which we are acquainted
are faulty.
We will begin with the natural beginning of the subject. Three alternatives are conceivable: The members of a state must either have (1) all
things or (2) nothing in common, or (3) some things in common and
some not. That they should have nothing in common is clearly impossible, for the constitution is a community, and must at any rate have a
common place—one city will be in one place, and the citizens are those
who share in that one city. But should a well ordered state have all
Politics/23
things, as far as may be, in common, or some only and not others? For
the citizens might conceivably have wives and children and property in
common, as Socrates proposes in the Republic of Plato. Which is better, our present condition, or the proposed new order of society.
Part II
There are many difficulties in the community of women. And the principle on which Socrates rests the necessity of such an institution evidently is not established by his arguments. Further, as a means to the
end which he ascribes to the state, the scheme, taken literally is impracticable, and how we are to interpret it is nowhere precisely stated. I am
speaking of the premise from which the argument of Socrates proceeds,
‘that the greater the unity of the state the better.’ Is it not obvious that a
state may at length attain such a degree of unity as to be no longer a
state? since the nature of a state is to be a plurality, and in tending to
greater unity, from being a state, it becomes a family, and from being a
family, an individual; for the family may be said to be more than the
state, and the individual than the family. So that we ought not to attain
this greatest unity even if we could, for it would be the destruction of the
state. Again, a state is not made up only of so many men, but of different kinds of men; for similars do not constitute a state. It is not like a
military alliance The usefulness of the latter depends upon its quantity
even where there is no difference in quality (for mutual protection is the
end aimed at), just as a greater weight of anything is more useful than a
less (in like manner, a state differs from a nation, when the nation has
not its population organized in villages, but lives an Arcadian sort of
life); but the elements out of which a unity is to be formed differ in kind.
Wherefore the principle of compensation, as I have already remarked in
the Ethics, is the salvation of states. Even among freemen and equals
this is a principle which must be maintained, for they cannot an rule
together, but must change at the end of a year or some other period of
time or in some order of succession. The result is that upon this plan
they all govern; just as if shoemakers and carpenters were to exchange
their occupations, and the same persons did not always continue shoemakers and carpenters. And since it is better that this should be so in
politics as well, it is clear that while there should be continuance of the
same persons in power where this is possible, yet where this is not possible by reason of the natural equality of the citizens, and at the same
time it is just that an should share in the government (whether to govern
24/Aristotle
be a good thing or a bad), an approximation to this is that equals should
in turn retire from office and should, apart from official position, be
treated alike. Thus the one party rule and the others are ruled in turn, as
if they were no longer the same persons. In like manner when they hold
office there is a variety in the offices held. Hence it is evident that a city
is not by nature one in that sense which some persons affirm; and that
what is said to be the greatest good of cities is in reality their destruction; but surely the good of things must be that which preserves them.
Again, in another point of view, this extreme unification of the state is
clearly not good; for a family is more self-sufficing than an individual,
and a city than a family, and a city only comes into being when the
community is large enough to be self-sufficing. If then self-sufficiency
is to be desired, the lesser degree of unity is more desirable than the
greater.
Part III
But, even supposing that it were best for the community to have the
greatest degree of unity, this unity is by no means proved to follow from
the fact ‘of all men saying “mine” and “not mine” at the same instant of
time,’ which, according to Socrates, is the sign of perfect unity in a
state. For the word ‘all’ is ambiguous. If the meaning be that every
individual says ‘mine’ and ‘not mine’ at the same time, then perhaps the
result at which Socrates aims may be in some degree accomplished;
each man will call the same person his own son and the same person his
wife, and so of his property and of all that falls to his lot. This, however,
is not the way in which people would speak who had their had their
wives and children in common; they would say ‘all’ but not ‘each.’ In
like manner their property would be described as belonging to them, not
severally but collectively. There is an obvious fallacy in the term ‘all’:
like some other words, ‘both,’ ‘odd,’ ‘even,’ it is ambiguous, and even
in abstract argument becomes a source of logical puzzles. That all persons call the same thing mine in the sense in which each does so may be
a fine thing, but it is impracticable; or if the words are taken in the other
sense, such a unity in no way conduces to harmony. And there is another
objection to the proposal. For that which is common to the greatest
number has the least care bestowed upon it. Every one thinks chiefly of
his own, hardly at all of the common interest; and only when he is himself concerned as an individual. For besides other considerations, everybody is more inclined to neglect the duty which he expects another to
Politics/25
fulfill; as in families many attendants are often less useful than a few.
Each citizen will have a thousand sons who will not be his sons individually but anybody will be equally the son of anybody, and will therefore be neglected by all alike. Further, upon this principle, every one
will use the word ‘mine’ of one who is prospering or the reverse, however small a fraction he may himself be of the whole number; the same
boy will be ‘so and so’s son,’ the son of each of the thousand, or whatever be the number of the citizens; and even about this he will not be
positive; for it is impossible to know who chanced to have a child, or
whether, if one came into existence, it has survived. But which is better—for each to say ‘mine’ in this way, making a man the same relation
to two thousand or ten thousand citizens, or to use the word ‘mine’ in
the ordinary and more restricted sense? For usually the same person is
called by one man his own son whom another calls his own brother or
cousin or kinsman—blood relation or connection by marriage either of
himself or of some relation of his, and yet another his clansman or tribesman; and how much better is it to be the real cousin of somebody than to
be a son after Plato’s fashion! Nor is there any way of preventing brothers and children and fathers and mothers from sometimes recognizing
one another; for children are born like their parents, and they will necessarily be finding indications of their relationship to one another. Geographers declare such to be the fact; they say that in part of Upper Libya,
where the women are common, nevertheless the children who are born
are assigned to their respective fathers on the ground of their likeness.
And some women, like the females of other animals—for example, mares
and cows—have a strong tendency to produce offspring resembling their
parents, as was the case with the Pharsalian mare called Honest.
Part IV
Other evils, against which it is not easy for the authors of such a community to guard, will be assaults and homicides, voluntary as well as
involuntary, quarrels and slanders, all which are most unholy acts when
committed against fathers and mothers and near relations, but not equally
unholy when there is no relationship. Moreover, they are much more
likely to occur if the relationship is unknown, and, when they have occurred, the customary expiations of them cannot be made. Again, how
strange it is that Socrates, after having made the children common, should
hinder lovers from carnal intercourse only, but should permit love and
familiarities between father and son or between brother and brother,
26/Aristotle
than which nothing can be more unseemly, since even without them love
of this sort is improper. How strange, too, to forbid intercourse for no
other reason than the violence of the pleasure, as though the relationship
of father and son or of brothers with one another made no difference.
This community of wives and children seems better suited to the
husbandmen than to the guardians, for if they have wives and children
in common, they will be bound to one another by weaker ties, as a
subject class should be, and they will remain obedient and not rebel. In
a word, the result of such a law would be just the opposite of which
good laws ought to have, and the intention of Socrates in making these
regulations about women and children would defeat itself. For friendship we believe to be the greatest good of states and the preservative of
them against revolutions; neither is there anything which Socrates so
greatly lauds as the unity of the state which he and all the world declare
to be created by friendship. But the unity which he commends would be
like that of the lovers in the Symposium, who, as Aristophanes says,
desire to grow together in the excess of their affection, and from being
two to become one, in which case one or both would certainly perish.
Whereas in a state having women and children common, love will be
watery; and the father will certainly not say ‘my son,’ or the son ‘my
father.’ As a little sweet wine mingled with a great deal of water is
imperceptible in the mixture, so, in this sort of community, the idea of
relationship which is based upon these names will be lost; there is no
reason why the so-called father should care about the son, or the son
about the father, or brothers about one another. Of the two qualities
which chiefly inspire regard and affection—that a thing is your own and
that it is your only one—neither can exist in such a state as this.
Again, the transfer of children as soon as they are born from the
rank of husbandmen or of artisans to that of guardians, and from the
rank of guardians into a lower rank, will be very difficult to arrange; the
givers or transferrers cannot but know whom they are giving and transferring, and to whom. And the previously mentioned evils, such as assaults, unlawful loves, homicides, will happen more often amongst those
who are transferred to the lower classes, or who have a place assigned
to them among the guardians; for they will no longer call the members
of the class they have left brothers, and children, and fathers, and mothers, and will not, therefore, be afraid of committing any crimes by reason of consanguinity. Touching the community of wives and children,
let this be our conclusion.
Politics/27
Part V
Next let us consider what should be our arrangements about property:
should the citizens of the perfect state have their possessions in common
or not? This question may be discussed separately from the enactments
about women and children. Even supposing that the women and children belong to individuals, according to the custom which is at present
universal, may there not be an advantage in having and using possessions in common? Three cases are possible: (1) the soil may be appropriated, but the produce may be thrown for consumption into the common stock; and this is the practice of some nations. Or (2), the soil may
be common, and may be cultivated in common, but the produce divided
among individuals for their private use; this is a form of common property which is said to exist among certain barbarians. Or (3), the soil and
the produce may be alike common.
When the husbandmen are not the owners, the case will be different
and easier to deal with; but when they till the ground for themselves the
question of ownership will give a world of trouble. If they do not share
equally enjoyments and toils, those who labor much and get little will
necessarily complain of those who labor little and receive or consume
much. But indeed there is always a difficulty in men living together and
having all human relations in common, but especially in their having
common property. The partnerships of fellow-travelers are an example
to the point; for they generally fall out over everyday matters and quarrel about any trifle which turns up. So with servants: we are most able
to take offense at those with whom we most we most frequently come
into contact in daily life.
These are only some of the disadvantages which attend the community of property; the present arrangement, if improved as it might be by
good customs and laws, would be far better, and would have the advantages of both systems. Property should be in a certain sense common,
but, as a general rule, private; for, when everyone has a distinct interest,
men will not complain of one another, and they will make more progress,
because every one will be attending to his own business. And yet by
reason of goodness, and in respect of use, ‘Friends,’ as the proverb
says, ‘will have all things common.’ Even now there are traces of such
a principle, showing that it is not impracticable, but, in well-ordered
states, exists already to a certain extent and may be carried further. For,
although every man has his own property, some things he will place at
28/Aristotle
the disposal of his friends, while of others he shares the use with them.
The Lacedaemonians, for example, use one another’s slaves, and horses,
and dogs, as if they were their own; and when they lack provisions on a
journey, they appropriate what they find in the fields throughout the
country. It is clearly better that property should be private, but the use
of it common; and the special business of the legislator is to create in
men this benevolent disposition. Again, how immeasurably greater is
the pleasure, when a man feels a thing to be his own; for surely the love
of self is a feeling implanted by nature and not given in vain, although
selfishness is rightly censured; this, however, is not the mere love of
self, but the love of self in excess, like the miser’s love of money; for all,
or almost all, men love money and other such objects in a measure. And
further, there is the greatest pleasure in doing a kindness or service to
friends or guests or companions, which can only be rendered when a
man has private property. These advantages are lost by excessive unification of the state. The exhibition of two virtues, besides, is visibly
annihilated in such a state: first, temperance towards women (for it is an
honorable action to abstain from another’s wife for temperance’ sake);
secondly, liberality in the matter of property. No one, when men have all
things in common, will any longer set an example of liberality or do any
liberal action; for liberality consists in the use which is made of property.
Such legislation may have a specious appearance of benevolence;
men readily listen to it, and are easily induced to believe that in some
wonderful manner everybody will become everybody’s friend, especially
when some one is heard denouncing the evils now existing in states,
suits about contracts, convictions for perjury, flatteries of rich men and
the like, which are said to arise out of the possession of private property.
These evils, however, are due to a very different cause—the wickedness
of human nature. Indeed, we see that there is much more quarrelling
among those who have all things in common, though there are not many
of them when compared with the vast numbers who have private property.
Again, we ought to reckon, not only the evils from which the citizens will be saved, but also the advantages which they will lose. The life
which they are to lead appears to be quite impracticable. The error of
Socrates must be attributed to the false notion of unity from which he
starts. Unity there should be, both of the family and of the state, but in
some respects only. For there is a point at which a state may attain such
Politics/29
a degree of unity as to be no longer a state, or at which, without actually
ceasing to exist, it will become an inferior state, like harmony passing
into unison, or rhythm which has been reduced to a single foot. The
state, as I was saying, is a plurality which should be united and made
into a community by education; and it is strange that the author of a
system of education which he thinks will make the state virtuous, should
expect to improve his citizens by regulations of this sort, and not by
philosophy or by customs and laws, like those which prevail at Sparta
and Crete respecting common meals, whereby the legislator has made
property common. Let us remember that we should not disregard the
experience of ages; in the multitude of years these things, if they were
good, would certainly not have been unknown; for almost everything
has been found out, although sometimes they are not put together; in
other cases men do not use the knowledge which they have. Great light
would be thrown on this subject if we could see such a form of government in the actual process of construction; for the legislator could not
form a state at all without distributing and dividing its constituents into
associations for common meals, and into phratries and tribes. But all
this legislation ends only in forbidding agriculture to the guardians, a
prohibition which the Lacedaemonians try to enforce already.
But, indeed, Socrates has not said, nor is it easy to decide, what in
such a community will be the general form of the state. The citizens who
are not guardians are the majority, and about them nothing has been
determined: are the husbandmen, too, to have their property in common? Or is each individual to have his own? And are the wives and
children to be individual or common. If, like the guardians, they are to
have all things in common, what do they differ from them, or what will
they gain by submitting to their government? Or, upon what principle
would they submit, unless indeed the governing class adopt the ingenious policy of the Cretans, who give their slaves the same institutions
as their own, but forbid them gymnastic exercises and the possession of
arms. If, on the other hand, the inferior classes are to be like other cities
in respect of marriage and property, what will be the form of the community? Must it not contain two states in one, each hostile to the other
He makes the guardians into a mere occupying garrison, while the husbandmen and artisans and the rest are the real citizens. But if so the
suits and quarrels, and all the evils which Socrates affirms to exist in
other states, will exist equally among them. He says indeed that, having
so good an education, the citizens will not need many laws, for example
30/Aristotle
laws about the city or about the markets; but then he confines his education to the guardians. Again, he makes the husbandmen owners of the
property upon condition of their paying a tribute. But in that case they
are likely to be much more unmanageable and conceited than the Helots,
or Penestae, or slaves in general. And whether community of wives and
property be necessary for the lower equally with the higher class or not,
and the questions akin to this, what will be the education, form of government, laws of the lower class, Socrates has nowhere determined:
neither is it easy to discover this, nor is their character of small importance if the common life of the guardians is to be maintained.
Again, if Socrates makes the women common, and retains private
property, the men will see to the fields, but who will see to the house?
And who will do so if the agricultural class have both their property and
their wives in common? Once more: it is absurd to argue, from the analogy of the animals, that men and women should follow the same pursuits, for animals have not to manage a household. The government,
too, as constituted by Socrates, contains elements of danger; for he makes
the same persons always rule. And if this is often a cause of disturbance
among the meaner sort, how much more among high-spirited warriors?
But that the persons whom he makes rulers must be the same is evident;
for the gold which the God mingles in the souls of men is not at one time
given to one, at another time to another, but always to the same: as he
says, ‘God mingles gold in some, and silver in others, from their very
birth; but brass and iron in those who are meant to be artisans and
husbandmen.’ Again, he deprives the guardians even of happiness, and
says that the legislator ought to make the whole state happy. But the
whole cannot be happy unless most, or all, or some of its parts enjoy
happiness. In this respect happiness is not like the even principle in
numbers, which may exist only in the whole, but in neither of the parts;
not so happiness. And if the guardians are not happy, who are? Surely
not the artisans, or the common people. The Republic of which Socrates
discourses has all these difficulties, and others quite as great.
Part VI
The same, or nearly the same, objections apply to Plato’s later work, the
Laws, and therefore we had better examine briefly the constitution which
is therein described. In the Republic, Socrates has definitely settled in
all a few questions only; such as the community of women and children,
the community of property, and the constitution of the state. The popu-
Politics/31
lation is divided into two classes—one of husbandmen, and the other of
warriors; from this latter is taken a third class of counselors and rulers
of the state. But Socrates has not determined whether the husbandmen
and artisans are to have a share in the government, and whether they,
too, are to carry arms and share in military service, or not. He certainly
thinks that the women ought to share in the education of the guardians,
and to fight by their side. The remainder of the work is filled up with
digressions foreign to the main subject, and with discussions about the
education of the guardians. In the Laws there is hardly anything but
laws; not much is said about the constitution. This, which he had intended to make more of the ordinary type, he gradually brings round to
the other or ideal form. For with the exception of the community of
women and property, he supposes everything to be the same in both
states; there is to be the same education; the citizens of both are to live
free from servile occupations, and there are to be common meals in
both. The only difference is that in the Laws, the common meals are
extended to women, and the warriors number 5000, but in the Republic
only 1000.
The discourses of Socrates are never commonplace; they always
exhibit grace and originality and thought; but perfection in everything
can hardly be expected. We must not overlook the fact that the number
of 5000 citizens, just now mentioned, will require a territory as large as
Babylon, or some other huge site, if so many persons are to be supported in idleness, together with their women and attendants, who will
be a multitude many times as great. In framing an ideal we may assume
what we wish, but should avoid impossibilities.
It is said that the legislator ought to have his eye directed to two
points—the people and the country. But neighboring countries also must
not be forgotten by him, firstly because the state for which he legislates
is to have a political and not an isolated life. For a state must have such
a military force as will be serviceable against her neighbors, and not
merely useful at home. Even if the life of action is not admitted to be the
best, either for individuals or states, still a city should be formidable to
enemies, whether invading or retreating.
There is another point: Should not the amount of property be defined in some way which differs from this by being clearer? For Socrates
says that a man should have so much property as will enable him to live
temperately, which is only a way of saying ‘to live well’; this is too
general a conception. Further, a man may live temperately and yet mis-
32/Aristotle
erably. A better definition would be that a man must have so much
property as will enable him to live not only temperately but liberally; if
the two are parted, liberally will combine with luxury; temperance will
be associated with toil. For liberality and temperance are the only eligible qualities which have to do with the use of property. A man cannot
use property with mildness or courage, but temperately and liberally he
may; and therefore the practice of these virtues is inseparable from property. There is an inconsistency, too, in too, in equalizing the property
and not regulating the number of the citizens; the population is to remain unlimited, and he thinks that it will be sufficiently equalized by a
certain number of marriages being unfruitful, however many are born
to others, because he finds this to be the case in existing states. But
greater care will be required than now; for among ourselves, whatever
may be the number of citizens, the property is always distributed among
them, and therefore no one is in want; but, if the property were incapable of division as in the Laws, the supernumeraries, whether few or
many, would get nothing. One would have thought that it was even more
necessary to limit population than property; and that the limit should be
fixed by calculating the chances of mortality in the children, and of
sterility in married persons. The neglect of this subject, which in existing states is so common, is a never-failing cause of poverty among the
citizens; and poverty is the parent of revolution and crime. Pheidon the
Corinthian, who was one of the most ardent legislators, thought that the
families and the number of citizens ought to remain the same, although
originally all the lots may have been of different sizes: but in the Laws
the opposite principle is maintained. What in our opinion is the right
arrangement will have to be explained hereafter.
There is another omission in the Laws: Socrates does not tell us
how the rulers differ from their subjects; he only says that they should
be related as the warp and the woof, which are made out of different
wools. He allows that a man’s whole property may be increased fivefold, but why should not his land also increase to a certain extent? Again,
will the good management of a household be promoted by his arrangement of homesteads? For he assigns to each individual two homesteads
in separate places, and it is difficult to live in two houses.
The whole system of government tends to be neither democracy nor
oligarchy, but something in a mean between them, which is usually called
a polity, and is composed of the heavy-armed soldiers. Now, if he intended to frame a constitution which would suit the greatest number of
Politics/33
states, he was very likely right, but not if he meant to say that this
constitutional form came nearest to his first or ideal state; for many
would prefer the Lacedaemonian, or, possibly, some other more aristocratic government. Some, indeed, say that the best constitution is a combination of all existing forms, and they praise the Lacedaemonian because it is made up of oligarchy, monarchy, and democracy, the king
forming the monarchy, and the council of elders the oligarchy while the
democratic element is represented by the Ephors; for the Ephors are
selected from the people. Others, however, declare the Ephoralty to be a
tyranny, and find the element of democracy in the common meals and in
the habits of daily life. In the Laws it is maintained that the best constitution is made up of democracy and tyranny, which are either not constitutions at all, or are the worst of all. But they are nearer the truth who
combine many forms; for the constitution is better which is made up of
more numerous elements. The constitution proposed in the Laws has no
element of monarchy at all; it is nothing but oligarchy and democracy,
leaning rather to oligarchy. This is seen in the mode of appointing magistrates; for although the appointment of them by lot from among those
who have been already selected combines both elements, the way in
which the rich are compelled by law to attend the assembly and vote for
magistrates or discharge other political duties, while the rest may do as
they like, and the endeavor to have the greater number of the magistrates appointed out of the richer classes and the highest officers selected from those who have the greatest incomes, both these are oligarchical features. The oligarchical principle prevails also in the choice of
the council, for all are compelled to choose, but the compulsion extends
only to the choice out of the first class, and of an equal number out of
the second class and out of the third class, but not in this latter case to
all the voters but to those of the first three classes; and the selection of
candidates out of the fourth class is only compulsory on the first and
second. Then, from the persons so chosen, he says that there ought to be
an equal number of each class selected. Thus a preponderance will be
given to the better sort of people, who have the larger incomes, because
many of the lower classes, not being compelled will not vote. These
considerations, and others which will be adduced when the time comes
for examining similar polities, tend to show that states like Plato’s should
not be composed of democracy and monarchy. There is also a danger in
electing the magistrates out of a body who are themselves elected; for, if
but a small number choose to combine, the elections will always go as
34/Aristotle
they desire. Such is the constitution which is described in the Laws.
Part VII
Other constitutions have been proposed; some by private persons, others by philosophers and statesmen, which all come nearer to established
or existing ones than either of Plato’s. No one else has introduced such
novelties as the community of women and children, or public tables for
women: other legislators begin with what is necessary. In the opinion of
some, the regulation of property is the chief point of all, that being the
question upon which all revolutions turn. This danger was recognized
by Phaleas of Chalcedon, who was the first to affirm that the citizens of
a state ought to have equal possessions. He thought that in a new colony
the equalization might be accomplished without difficulty, not so easily
when a state was already established; and that then the shortest way of
compassing the desired end would be for the rich to give and not to
receive marriage portions, and for the poor not to give but to receive
them.
Plato in the Laws was of opinion that, to a certain extent, accumulation should be allowed, forbidding, as I have already observed, any
citizen to possess more than five times the minimum qualification But
those who make such laws should remember what they are apt to forget—that the legislator who fixes the amount of property should also fix
the number of children; for, if the children are too many for the property,
the law must be broken. And, besides the violation of the law, it is a bad
thing that many from being rich should become poor; for men of ruined
fortunes are sure to stir up revolutions. That the equalization of property exercises an influence on political society was clearly understood
even by some of the old legislators. Laws were made by Solon and
others prohibiting an individual from possessing as much land as he
pleased; and there are other laws in states which forbid the sale of property: among the Locrians, for example, there is a law that a man is not to
sell his property unless he can prove unmistakably that some misfortune
has befallen him. Again, there have been laws which enjoin the preservation of the original lots. Such a law existed in the island of Leucas,
and the abrogation of it made the constitution too democratic, for the
rulers no longer had the prescribed qualification. Again, where there is
equality of property, the amount may be either too large or too small,
and the possessor may be living either in luxury or penury. Clearly,
then, the legislator ought not only to aim at the equalization of proper-
Politics/35
ties, but at moderation in their amount. Further, if he prescribe this
moderate amount equally to all, he will be no nearer the mark; for it is
not the possessions but the desires of mankind which require to be equalized, and this is impossible, unless a sufficient education is provided by
the laws. But Phaleas will probably reply that this is precisely what he
means; and that, in his opinion, there ought to be in states, not only
equal property, but equal education. Still he should tell precisely what
he means; and that, in his opinion, there ought to be in be in having one
and the same for all, if it is of a sort that predisposes men to avarice, or
ambition, or both. Moreover, civil troubles arise, not only out of the
inequality of property, but out of the inequality of honor, though in opposite ways. For the common people quarrel about the inequality of
property, the higher class about the equality of honor; as the poet says,
“The bad and good alike in honor share.”
There are crimes of which the motive is want; and for these Phaleas
expects to find a cure in the equalization of property, which will take
away from a man the temptation to be a highwayman, because he is
hungry or cold. But want is not the sole incentive to crime; men also
wish to enjoy themselves and not to be in a state of desire—they wish to
cure some desire, going beyond the necessities of life, which preys upon
them; nay, this is not the only reason—they may desire superfluities in
order to enjoy pleasures unaccompanied with pain, and therefore they
commit crimes.
Now what is the cure of these three disorders? Of the first, moderate possessions and occupation; of the second, habits of temperance; as
to the third, if any desire pleasures which depend on themselves, they
will find the satisfaction of their desires nowhere but in philosophy; for
all other pleasures we are dependent on others. The fact is that the greatest crimes are caused by excess and not by necessity. Men do not become tyrants in order that they may not suffer cold; and hence great is
the honor bestowed, not on him who kills a thief, but on him who kills a
tyrant. Thus we see that the institutions of Phaleas avail only against
petty crimes.
There is another objection to them. They are chiefly designed to
promote the internal welfare of the state. But the legislator should consider also its relation to neighboring nations, and to all who are outside
of it. The government must be organized with a view to military strength;
36/Aristotle
and of this he has said not a word. And so with respect to property: there
should not only be enough to supply the internal wants of the state, but
also to meet dangers coming from without. The property of the state
should not be so large that more powerful neighbors may be tempted by
it, while the owners are unable to repel the invaders; nor yet so small
that the state is unable to maintain a war even against states of equal
power, and of the same character. Phaleas has not laid down any rule;
but we should bear in mind that abundance of wealth is an advantage.
The best limit will probably be, that a more powerful neighbor must
have no inducement to go to war with you by reason of the excess of
your wealth, but only such as he would have had if you had possessed
less. There is a story that Eubulus, when Autophradates was going to
besiege Atarneus, told him to consider how long the operation would
take, and then reckon up the cost which would be incurred in the time.
‘For,’ said he, ‘I am willing for a smaller sum than that to leave Atarneus
at once.’ These words of Eubulus made an impression on Autophradates,
and he desisted from the siege.
The equalization of property is one of the things that tend to prevent
the citizens from quarrelling. Not that the gain in this direction is very
great. For the nobles will be dissatisfied because they think themselves
worthy of more than an equal share of honors; and this is often found to
be a cause of sedition and revolution. And the avarice of mankind is
insatiable; at one time two obols was pay enough; but now, when this
sum has become customary, men always want more and more without
end; for it is of the nature of desire not to be satisfied, and most men live
only for the gratification of it. The beginning of reform is not so much to
equalize property as to train the nobler sort of natures not to desire
more, and to prevent the lower from getting more; that is to say, they
must be kept down, but not ill-treated. Besides, the equalization proposed by Phaleas is imperfect; for he only equalizes land, whereas a
man may be rich also in slaves, and cattle, and money, and in the abundance of what are called his movables. Now either all these things must
be equalized, or some limit must be imposed on them, or they must an be
let alone. It would appear that Phaleas is legislating for a small city
only, if, as he supposes, all the artisans are to be public slaves and not to
form a supplementary part of the body of citizens. But if there is a law
that artisans are to be public slaves, it should only apply to those engaged on public works, as at Epidamnus, or at Athens on the plan which
Diophantus once introduced.
Politics/37
From these observations any one may judge how far Phaleas was
wrong or right in his ideas.
Part VIII
Hippodamus, the son of Euryphon, a native of Miletus, the same who
invented the art of planning cities, and who also laid out the Piraeus—a
strange man, whose fondness for distinction led him into a general eccentricity of life, which made some think him affected (for he would
wear flowing hair and expensive ornaments; but these were worn on a
cheap but warm garment both in winter and summer); he, besides aspiring to be an adept in the knowledge of nature, was the first person not a
statesman who made inquiries about the best form of government.
The city of Hippodamus was composed of 10,000 citizens divided
into three parts—one of artisans, one of husbandmen, and a third of
armed defenders of the state. He also divided the land into three parts,
one sacred, one public, the third private: the first was set apart to maintain the customary worship of the Gods, the second was to support the
warriors, the third was the property of the husbandmen. He also divided
laws into three classes, and no more, for he maintained that there are
three subjects of lawsuits—insult, injury, and homicide. He likewise
instituted a single final court of appeal, to which all causes seeming to
have been improperly decided might be referred; this court he formed of
elders chosen for the purpose. He was further of opinion that the decisions of the courts ought not to be given by the use of a voting pebble,
but that every one should have a tablet on which he might not only write
a simple condemnation, or leave the tablet blank for a simple acquittal;
but, if he partly acquitted and partly condemned, he was to distinguish
accordingly. To the existing law he objected that it obliged the judges to
be guilty of perjury, whichever way they voted. He also enacted that
those who discovered anything for the good of the state should be honored; and he provided that the children of citizens who died in battle
should be maintained at the public expense, as if such an enactment had
never been heard of before, yet it actually exists at Athens and in other
places. As to the magistrates, he would have them all elected by the
people, that is, by the three classes already mentioned, and those who
were elected were to watch over the interests of the public, of strangers,
and of orphans. These are the most striking points in the constitution of
Hippodamus. There is not much else.
The first of these proposals to which objection may be taken is the
38/Aristotle
threefold division of the citizens. The artisans, and the husbandmen,
and the warriors, all have a share in the government. But the husbandmen have no arms, and the artisans neither arms nor land, and therefore
they become all but slaves of the warrior class. That they should share
in all the offices is an impossibility; for generals and guardians of the
citizens, and nearly all the principal magistrates, must be taken from the
class of those who carry arms. Yet, if the two other classes have no
share in the government, how can they be loyal citizens? It may be said
that those who have arms must necessarily be masters of both the other
classes, but this is not so easily accomplished unless they are numerous;
and if they are, why should the other classes share in the government at
all, or have power to appoint magistrates? Further, what use are farmers to the city? Artisans there must be, for these are wanted in every city,
and they can live by their craft, as elsewhere; and the husbandmen too,
if they really provided the warriors with food, might fairly have a share
in the government. But in the republic of Hippodamus they are supposed to have land of their own, which they cultivate for their private
benefit. Again, as to this common land out of which the soldiers are
maintained, if they are themselves to be the cultivators of it, the warrior
class will be identical with the husbandmen, although the legislator intended to make a distinction between them. If, again, there are to be
other cultivators distinct both from the husbandmen, who have land of
their own, and from the warriors, they will make a fourth class, which
has no place in the state and no share in anything. Or, if the same persons are to cultivate their own lands, and those of the public as well,
they will have difficulty in supplying the quantity of produce which will
maintain two households: and why, in this case, should there be any
division, for they might find food themselves and give to the warriors
from the same land and the same lots? There is surely a great confusion
in all this.
Neither is the law to commended which says that the judges, when a
simple issue is laid before them, should distinguish in their judgement;
for the judge is thus converted into an arbitrator. Now, in an arbitration,
although the arbitrators are many, they confer with one another about
the decision, and therefore they can distinguish; but in courts of law this
is impossible, and, indeed, most legislators take pains to prevent the
judges from holding any communication with one another. Again, will
there not be confusion if the judge thinks that damages should be given,
but not so much as the suitor demands? He asks, say, for twenty minae,
Politics/39
and the judge allows him ten minae (or in general the suitor asks for
more and the judge allows less), while another judge allows five, another four minae. In this way they will go on splitting up the damages,
and some will grant the whole and others nothing: how is the final reckoning to be taken? Again, no one contends that he who votes for a simple
acquittal or condemnation perjures himself, if the indictment has been
laid in an unqualified form; and this is just, for the judge who acquits
does not decide that the defendant owes nothing, but that he does not
owe the twenty minae. He only is guilty of perjury who thinks that the
defendant ought not to pay twenty minae, and yet condemns him.
To honor those who discover anything which is useful to the state is
a proposal which has a specious sound, but cannot safely be enacted by
law, for it may encourage informers, and perhaps even lead to political
commotions. This question involves another. It has been doubted whether
it is or is not expedient to make any changes in the laws of a country,
even if another law be better. Now, if an changes are inexpedient, we
can hardly assent to the proposal of Hippodamus; for, under pretense of
doing a public service, a man may introduce measures which are really
destructive to the laws or to the constitution. But, since we have touched
upon this subject, perhaps we had better go a little into detail, for, as I
was saying, there is a difference of opinion, and it may sometimes seem
desirable to make changes. Such changes in the other arts and sciences
have certainly been beneficial; medicine, for example, and gymnastic,
and every other art and craft have departed from traditional usage. And,
if politics be an art, change must be necessary in this as in any other art.
That improvement has occurred is shown by the fact that old customs
are exceedingly simple and barbarous. For the ancient Hellenes went
about armed and bought their brides of each other. The remains of ancient laws which have come down to us are quite absurd; for example,
at Cumae there is a law about murder, to the effect that if the accuser
produce a certain number of witnesses from among his own kinsmen,
the accused shall be held guilty. Again, men in general desire the good,
and not merely what their fathers had. But the primeval inhabitants,
whether they were born of the earth or were the survivors of some destruction, may be supposed to have been no better than ordinary or even
foolish people among ourselves (such is certainly the tradition concerning the earth-born men); and it would be ridiculous to rest contented
with their notions. Even when laws have been written down, they ought
not always to remain unaltered. As in other sciences, so in politics, it is
40/Aristotle
impossible that all things should be precisely set down in writing; for
enactments must be universal, but actions are concerned with particulars. Hence we infer that sometimes and in certain cases laws may be
changed; but when we look at the matter from another point of view,
great caution would seem to be required. For the habit of lightly changing the laws is an evil, and, when the advantage is small, some errors
both of lawgivers and rulers had better be left; the citizen will not gain
so much by making the change as he will lose by the habit of disobedience. The analogy of the arts is false; a change in a law is a very different thing from a change in an art. For the law has no power to command
obedience except that of habit, which can only be given by time, so that
a readiness to change from old to new laws enfeebles the power of the
law. Even if we admit that the laws are to be changed, are they all to be
changed, and in every state? And are they to be changed by anybody
who likes, or only by certain persons? These are very important questions; and therefore we had better reserve the discussion of them to a
more suitable occasion.
Part IX
In the governments of Lacedaemon and Crete, and indeed in all governments, two points have to be considered: first, whether any particular
law is good or bad, when compared with the perfect state; secondly,
whether it is or is not consistent with the idea and character which the
lawgiver has set before his citizens. That in a well-ordered state the
citizens should have leisure and not have to provide for their daily wants
is generally acknowledged, but there is a difficulty in seeing how this
leisure is to be attained. The Thessalian Penestae have often risen against
their masters, and the Helots in like manner against the Lacedaemonians,
for whose misfortunes they are always lying in wait. Nothing, however,
of this kind has as yet happened to the Cretans; the reason probably is
that the neighboring cities, even when at war with one another, never
form an alliance with rebellious serfs, rebellions not being for their interest, since they themselves have a dependent population. Whereas all
the neighbors of the Lacedaemonians, whether Argives, Messenians, or
Arcadians, were their enemies. In Thessaly, again, the original revolt of
the slaves occurred because the Thessalians were still at war with the
neighboring Achaeans, Perrhaebians, and Magnesians. Besides, if there
were no other difficulty, the treatment or management of slaves is a
troublesome affair; for, if not kept in hand, they are insolent, and think
Politics/41
that they are as good as their masters, and, if harshly treated, they hate
and conspire against them. Now it is clear that when these are the results the citizens of a state have not found out the secret of managing
their subject population.
Again, the license of the Lacedaemonian women defeats the intention of the Spartan constitution, and is adverse to the happiness of the
state. For, a husband and wife being each a part of every family, the
state may be considered as about equally divided into men and women;
and, therefore, in those states in which the condition of the women is
bad, half the city may be regarded as having no laws. And this is what
has actually happened at Sparta; the legislator wanted to make the whole
state hardy and temperate, and he has carried out his intention in the
case of the men, but he has neglected the women, who live in every sort
of intemperance and luxury. The consequence is that in such a state
wealth is too highly valued, especially if the citizen fall under the dominion of their wives, after the manner of most warlike races, except the
Celts and a few others who openly approve of male loves. The old
mythologer would seem to have been right in uniting Ares and Aphrodite,
for all warlike races are prone to the love either of men or of women.
This was exemplified among the Spartans in the days of their greatness;
many things were managed by their women. But what difference does it
make whether women rule, or the rulers are ruled by women? The result
is the same. Even in regard to courage, which is of no use in daily life,
and is needed only in war, the influence of the Lacedaemonian women
has been most mischievous. The evil showed itself in the Theban invasion, when, unlike the women other cities, they were utterly useless and
caused more confusion than the enemy. This license of the Lacedaemonian
women existed from the earliest times, and was only what might be
expected. For, during the wars of the Lacedaemonians, first against the
Argives, and afterwards against the Arcadians and Messenians, the men
were long away from home, and, on the return of peace, they gave themselves into the legislator’s hand, already prepared by the discipline of a
soldier’s life (in which there are many elements of virtue), to receive his
enactments. But, when Lycurgus, as tradition says, wanted to bring the
women under his laws, they resisted, and he gave up the attempt. These
then are the causes of what then happened, and this defect in the constitution is clearly to be attributed to them. We are not, however, considering what is or is not to be excused, but what is right or wrong, and the
disorder of the women, as I have already said, not only gives an air of
42/Aristotle
indecorum to the constitution considered in itself, but tends in a measure
to foster avarice.
The mention of avarice naturally suggests a criticism on the inequality of property. While some of the Spartan citizen have quite small
properties, others have very large ones; hence the land has passed into
the hands of a few. And this is due also to faulty laws; for, although the
legislator rightly holds up to shame the sale or purchase of an inheritance, he allows anybody who likes to give or bequeath it. Yet both practices lead to the same result. And nearly two-fifths of the whole country
are held by women; this is owing to the number of heiresses and to the
large dowries which are customary. It would surely have been better to
have given no dowries at all, or, if any, but small or moderate ones. As
the law now stands, a man may bestow his heiress on any one whom he
pleases, and, if he die intestate, the privilege of giving her away descends to his heir. Hence, although the country is able to maintain 1500
cavalry and 30,000 hoplites, the whole number of Spartan citizens fell
below 1000. The result proves the faulty nature of their laws respecting
property; for the city sank under a single defeat; the want of men was
their ruin. There is a tradition that, in the days of their ancient kings,
they were in the habit of giving the rights of citizenship to strangers, and
therefore, in spite of their long wars, no lack of population was experienced by them; indeed, at one time Sparta is said to have numbered not
less than 10,000 citizens Whether this statement is true or not, it would
certainly have been better to have maintained their numbers by the equalization of property. Again, the law which relates to the procreation of
children is adverse to the correction of this inequality. For the legislator,
wanting to have as many Spartans as he could, encouraged the citizens
to have large families; and there is a law at Sparta that the father of
three sons shall be exempt from military service, and he who has four
from all the burdens of the state. Yet it is obvious that, if there were
many children, the land being distributed as it is, many of them must
necessarily fall into poverty.
The Lacedaemonian constitution is defective in another point; I mean
the Ephoralty. This magistracy has authority in the highest matters, but
the Ephors are chosen from the whole people, and so the office is apt to
fall into the hands of very poor men, who, being badly off, are open to
bribes. There have been many examples at Sparta of this evil in former
times; and quite recently, in the matter of the Andrians, certain of the
Ephors who were bribed did their best to ruin the state. And so great and
Politics/43
tyrannical is their power, that even the kings have been compelled to
court them, so that, in this way as well together with the royal office, the
whole constitution has deteriorated, and from being an aristocracy has
turned into a democracy. The Ephoralty certainly does keep the state
together; for the people are contented when they have a share in the
highest office, and the result, whether due to the legislator or to chance,
has been advantageous. For if a constitution is to be permanent, all the
parts of the state must wish that it should exist and the same arrangements be maintained. This is the case at Sparta, where the kings desire
its permanence because they have due honor in their own persons; the
nobles because they are represented in the council of elders (for the
office of elder is a reward of virtue); and the people, because all are
eligible to the Ephoralty. The election of Ephors out of the whole people
is perfectly right, but ought not to be carried on in the present fashion,
which is too childish. Again, they have the decision of great causes,
although they are quite ordinary men, and therefore they should not
determine them merely on their own judgment, but according to written
rules, and to the laws. Their way of life, too, is not in accordance with
the spirit of the constitution—they have a deal too much license; whereas,
in the case of the other citizens, the excess of strictness is so intolerable
that they run away from the law into the secret indulgence of sensual
pleasures.
Again, the council of elders is not free from defects. It may be said
that the elders are good men and well trained in manly virtue; and that,
therefore, there is an advantage to the state in having them. But that
judges of important causes should hold office for life is a disputable
thing, for the mind grows old as well as the body. And when men have
been educated in such a manner that even the legislator himself cannot
trust them, there is real danger. Many of the elders are well known to
have taken bribes and to have been guilty of partiality in public affairs.
And therefore they ought not to be irresponsible; yet at Sparta they are
so. But (it may be replied), ‘All magistracies are accountable to the
Ephors.’ Yes, but this prerogative is too great for them, and we maintain
that the control should be exercised in some other manner. Further, the
mode in which the Spartans elect their elders is childish; and it is improper that the person to be elected should canvass for the office; the
worthiest should be appointed, whether he chooses or not. And here the
legislator clearly indicates the same intention which appears in other
parts of his constitution; he would have his citizens ambitious, and he
44/Aristotle
has reckoned upon this quality in the election of the elders; for no one
would ask to be elected if he were not. Yet ambition and avarice, almost
more than any other passions, are the motives of crime.
Whether kings are or are not an advantage to states, I will consider
at another time; they should at any rate be chosen, not as they are now,
but with regard to their personal life and conduct. The legislator himself
obviously did not suppose that he could make them really good men; at
least he shows a great distrust of their virtue. For this reason the Spartans used to join enemies with them in the same embassy, and the quarrels between the kings were held to be conservative of the state.
Neither did the first introducer of the common meals, called ‘phiditia,’
regulate them well. The entertainment ought to have been provided at
the public cost, as in Crete; but among the Lacedaemonians every one is
expected to contribute, and some of them are too poor to afford the
expense; thus the intention of the legislator is frustrated. The common
meals were meant to be a popular institution, but the existing manner of
regulating them is the reverse of popular. For the very poor can scarcely
take part in them; and, according to ancient custom, those who cannot
contribute are not allowed to retain their rights of citizenship.
The law about the Spartan admirals has often been censured, and
with justice; it is a source of dissension, for the kings are perpetual
generals, and this office of admiral is but the setting up of another king.
The charge which Plato brings, in the Laws, against the intention of
the legislator, is likewise justified; the whole constitution has regard to
one part of virtue only—the virtue of the soldier, which gives victory in
war. So long as they were at war, therefore, their power was preserved,
but when they had attained empire they fell for of the arts of peace they
knew nothing, and had never engaged in any employment higher than
war. There is another error, equally great, into which they have fallen.
Although they truly think that the goods for which men contend are to
be acquired by virtue rather than by vice, they err in supposing that
these goods are to be preferred to the virtue which gains them.
Once more: the revenues of the state are ill-managed; there is no
money in the treasury, although they are obliged to carry on great wars,
and they are unwilling to pay taxes. The greater part of the land being in
the hands of the Spartans, they do not look closely into one another’s
contributions. The result which the legislator has produced is the reverse of beneficial; for he has made his city poor, and his citizens greedy.
Enough respecting the Spartan constitution, of which these are the
Politics/45
principal defects.
Part X
The Cretan constitution nearly resembles the Spartan, and in some few
points is quite as good; but for the most part less perfect in form. The
older constitutions are generally less elaborate than the later, and the
Lacedaemonian is said to be, and probably is, in a very great measure,
a copy of the Cretan. According to tradition, Lycurgus, when he ceased
to be the guardian of King Charillus, went abroad and spent most of his
time in Crete. For the two countries are nearly connected; the Lyctians
are a colony of the Lacedaemonians, and the colonists, when they came
to Crete, adopted the constitution which they found existing among the
inhabitants. Even to this day the Perioeci, or subject population of Crete,
are governed by the original laws which Minos is supposed to have
enacted. The island seems to be intended by nature for dominion in
Hellas, and to be well situated; it extends right across the sea, around
which nearly all the Hellenes are settled; and while one end is not far
from the Peloponnese, the other almost reaches to the region of Asia
about Triopium and Rhodes. Hence Minos acquired the empire of the
sea, subduing some of the islands and colonizing others; at last he invaded Sicily, where he died near Camicus.
The Cretan institutions resemble the Lacedaemonian. The Helots
are the husbandmen of the one, the Perioeci of the other, and both Cretans
and Lacedaemonians have common meals, which were anciently called
by the Lacedaemonians not ‘phiditia’ but ‘andria’; and the Cretans have
the same word, the use of which proves that the common meals originally came from Crete. Further, the two constitutions are similar; for
the office of the Ephors is the same as that of the Cretan Cosmi, the only
difference being that whereas the Ephors are five, the Cosmi are ten in
number. The elders, too, answer to the elders in Crete, who are termed
by the Cretans the council. And the kingly office once existed in Crete,
but was abolished, and the Cosmi have now the duty of leading them in
war. All classes share in the ecclesia, but it can only ratify the decrees of
the elders and the Cosmi.
The common meals of Crete are certainly better managed than the
Lacedaemonian; for in Lacedaemon every one pays so much per head,
or, if he fails, the law, as I have already explained, forbids him to exercise the rights of citizenship. But in Crete they are of a more popular
character. There, of all the fruits of the earth and cattle raised on the
46/Aristotle
public lands, and of the tribute which is paid by the Perioeci, one portion is assigned to the Gods and to the service of the state, and another to
the common meals, so that men, women, and children are all supported
out of a common stock. The legislator has many ingenious ways of
securing moderation in eating, which he conceives to be a gain; he likewise encourages the separation of men from women, lest they should
have too many children, and the companionship of men with one another—whether this is a good or bad thing I shall have an opportunity of
considering at another time. But that the Cretan common meals are better ordered than the Lacedaemonian there can be no doubt.
On the other hand, the Cosmi are even a worse institution than the
Ephors, of which they have all the evils without the good. Like the Ephors,
they are any chance persons, but in Crete this is not counterbalanced by
a corresponding political advantage. At Sparta every one is eligible, and
the body of the people, having a share in the highest office, want the
constitution to be permanent. But in Crete the Cosmi are elected out of
certain families, and not out of the whole people, and the elders out of
those who have been Cosmi.
The same criticism may be made about the Cretan, which has been
already made about the Lacedaemonian elders. Their irresponsibility
and life tenure is too great a privilege, and their arbitrary power of
acting upon their own judgment, and dispensing with written law, is
dangerous. It is no proof of the goodness of the institution that the people
are not discontented at being excluded from it. For there is no profit to
be made out of the office as out of the Ephoralty, since, unlike the Ephors,
the Cosmi, being in an island, are removed from temptation.
The remedy by which they correct the evil of this institution is an
extraordinary one, suited rather to a close oligarchy than to a constitutional state. For the Cosmi are often expelled by a conspiracy of their
own colleagues, or of private individuals; and they are allowed also to
resign before their term of office has expired. Surely all matters of this
kind are better regulated by law than by the will of man, which is a very
unsafe rule. Worst of all is the suspension of the office of Cosmi, a
device to which the nobles often have recourse when they will not submit to justice. This shows that the Cretan government, although possessing some of the characteristics of a constitutional state, is really a
close oligarchy.
The nobles have a habit, too, of setting up a chief; they get together
a party among the common people and their own friends and then quar-
Politics/47
rel and fight with one another. What is this but the temporary destruction of the state and dissolution of society? A city is in a dangerous
condition when those who are willing are also able to attack her. But, as
I have already said, the island of Crete is saved by her situation; distance has the same effect as the Lacedaemonian prohibition of strangers; and the Cretans have no foreign dominions. This is the reason why
the Perioeci are contented in Crete, whereas the Helots are perpetually
revolting. But when lately foreign invaders found their way into the
island, the weakness of the Cretan constitution was revealed. Enough of
the government of Crete.
Part XI
The Carthaginians are also considered to have an excellent form of government, which differs from that of any other state in several respects,
though it is in some very like the Lacedaemonian. Indeed, all three states—
the Lacedaemonian, the Cretan, and the Carthaginian—nearly resemble
one another, and are very different from any others. Many of the
Carthaginian institutions are excellent The superiority of their constitution is proved by the fact that the common people remain loyal to the
constitution the Carthaginians have never had any rebellion worth speaking of, and have never been under the rule of a tyrant.
Among the points in which the Carthaginian constitution resembles
the Lacedaemonian are the following: The common tables of the clubs
answer to the Spartan phiditia, and their magistracy of the 104 to the
Ephors; but, whereas the Ephors are any chance persons, the magistrates of the Carthaginians are elected according to merit—this is an
improvement. They have also their kings and their gerusia, or council of
elders, who correspond to the kings and elders of Sparta. Their kings,
unlike the Spartan, are not always of the same family, nor that an ordinary one, but if there is some distinguished family they are selected out
of it and not appointed by senority—this is far better. Such officers have
great power, and therefore, if they are persons of little worth, do a great
deal of harm, and they have already done harm at Lacedaemon.
Most of the defects or deviations from the perfect state, for which
the Carthaginian constitution would be censured, apply equally to all
the forms of government which we have mentioned. But of the deflections from aristocracy and constitutional government, some incline more
to democracy and some to oligarchy. The kings and elders, if unanimous, may determine whether they will or will not bring a matter before
48/Aristotle
the people, but when they are not unanimous, the people decide on such
matters as well. And whatever the kings and elders bring before the
people is not only heard but also determined by them, and any one who
likes may oppose it; now this is not permitted in Sparta and Crete. That
the magistrates of five who have under them many important matters
should be co-opted, that they should choose the supreme council of 100,
and should hold office longer than other magistrates (for they are virtually rulers both before and after they hold office)—these are oligarchical features; their being without salary and not elected by lot, and any
similar points, such as the practice of having all suits tried by the magistrates, and not some by one class of judges or jurors and some by
another, as at Lacedaemon, are characteristic of aristocracy. The
Carthaginian constitution deviates from aristocracy and inclines to oligarchy, chiefly on a point where popular opinion is on their side. For
men in general think that magistrates should be chosen not only for their
merit, but for their wealth: a man, they say, who is poor cannot rule
well—he has not the leisure. If, then, election of magistrates for their
wealth be characteristic of oligarchy, and election for merit of aristocracy, there will be a third form under which the constitution of Carthage
is comprehended; for the Carthaginians choose their magistrates, and
particularly the highest of them—their kings and generals—with an eye
both to merit and to wealth.
But we must acknowledge that, in thus deviating from aristocracy,
the legislator has committed an error. Nothing is more absolutely necessary than to provide that the highest class, not only when in office, but
when out of office, should have leisure and not disgrace themselves in
any way; and to this his attention should be first directed. Even if you
must have regard to wealth, in order to secure leisure, yet it is surely a
bad thing that the greatest offices, such as those of kings and generals,
should be bought. The law which allows this abuse makes wealth of
more account than virtue, and the whole state becomes avaricious. For,
whenever the chiefs of the state deem anything honorable, the other
citizens are sure to follow their example; and, where virtue has not the
first place, their aristocracy cannot be firmly established. Those who
have been at the expense of purchasing their places will be in the habit
of repaying themselves; and it is absurd to suppose that a poor and
honest man will be wanting to make gains, and that a lower stamp of
man who has incurred a great expense will not. Wherefore they should
rule who are able to rule best. And even if the legislator does not care to
Politics/49
protect the good from poverty, he should at any rate secure leisure for
them when in office.
It would seem also to be a bad principle that the same person should
hold many offices, which is a favorite practice among the Carthaginians,
for one business is better done by one man. The legislator should see to
this and should not appoint the same person to be a flute-player and a
shoemaker. Hence, where the state is large, it is more in accordance
both with constitutional and with democratic principles that the offices
of state should be distributed among many persons. For, as I said, this
arrangement is fairer to all, and any action familiarized by repetition is
better and sooner performed. We have a proof in military and naval
matters; the duties of command and of obedience in both these services
extend to all.
The government of the Carthaginians is oligarchical, but they successfully escape the evils of oligarchy by enriching one portion of the
people after another by sending them to their colonies. This is their
panacea and the means by which they give stability to the state. Accident favors them, but the legislator should be able to provide against
revolution without trusting to accidents. As things are, if any misfortune occurred, and the bulk of the subjects revolted, there would be no
way of restoring peace by legal methods.
Such is the character of the Lacedaemonian, Cretan, and
Carthaginian constitutions, which are justly celebrated.
Part XII
Of those who have treated of governments, some have never taken any
part at all in public affairs, but have passed their lives in a private station; about most of them, what was worth telling has been already told.
Others have been lawgivers, either in their own or in foreign cities, whose
affairs they have administered; and of these some have only made laws,
others have framed constitutions; for example, Lycurgus and Solon did
both. Of the Lacedaemonian constitution I have already spoken. As to
Solon, he is thought by some to have been a good legislator, who put an
end to the exclusiveness of the oligarchy, emancipated the people, established the ancient Athenian democracy, and harmonized the different
elements of the state. According to their view, the council of Areopagus
was an oligarchical element, the elected magistracy, aristocratical, and
the courts of law, democratical. The truth seems to be that the council
and the elected magistracy existed before the time of Solon, and were
50/Aristotle
retained by him, but that he formed the courts of law out of an the
citizens, thus creating the democracy, which is the very reason why he is
sometimes blamed. For in giving the supreme power to the law courts,
which are elected by lot, he is thought to have destroyed the non-democratic element. When the law courts grew powerful, to please the people
who were now playing the tyrant the old constitution was changed into
the existing democracy. Ephialtes and Pericles curtailed the power of
the Areopagus; Pericles also instituted the payment of the juries, and
thus every demagogue in turn increased the power of the democracy
until it became what we now see. All this is true; it seems, however, to
be the result of circumstances, and not to have been intended by Solon.
For the people, having been instrumental in gaining the empire of the
sea in the Persian War, began to get a notion of itself, and followed
worthless demagogues, whom the better class opposed. Solon, himself,
appears to have given the Athenians only that power of electing to offices and calling to account the magistrates which was absolutely necessary; for without it they would have been in a state of slavery and enmity to the government. All the magistrates he appointed from the notables and the men of wealth, that is to say, from the pentacosio-medimni,
or from the class called zeugitae, or from a third class of so-called knights
or cavalry. The fourth class were laborers who had no share in any
magistracy.
Mere legislators were Zaleucus, who gave laws to the Epizephyrian
Locrians, and Charondas, who legislated for his own city of Catana,
and for the other Chalcidian cities in Italy and Sicily. Some people attempt to make out that Onomacritus was the first person who had any
special skill in legislation, and that he, although a Locrian by birth, was
trained in Crete, where he lived in the exercise of his prophetic art; that
Thales was his companion, and that Lycurgus and Zaleucus were disciples of Thales, as Charondas was of Zaleucus. But their account is
quite inconsistent with chronology.
There was also Philolaus, the Corinthian, who gave laws to the
Thebans. This Philolaus was one of the family of the Bacchiadae, and a
lover of Diocles, the Olympic victor, who left Corinth in horror of the
incestuous passion which his mother Halcyone had conceived for him,
and retired to Thebes, where the two friends together ended their days.
The inhabitants still point out their tombs, which are in full view of one
another, but one is visible from the Corinthian territory, the other not.
Tradition says the two friends arranged them thus, Diocles out of horror
Politics/51
at his misfortunes, so that the land of Corinth might not be visible from
his tomb; Philolaus that it might. This is the reason why they settled at
Thebes, and so Philolaus legislated for the Thebans, and, besides some
other enactments, gave them laws about the procreation of children,
which they call the ‘Laws of Adoption.’ These laws were peculiar to
him, and were intended to preserve the number of the lots.
In the legislation of Charondas there is nothing remarkable, except
the suits against false witnesses. He is the first who instituted denunciation for perjury. His laws are more exact and more precisely expressed
than even those of our modern legislators.
(Characteristic of Phaleas is the equalization of property; of Plato,
the community of women, children, and property, the common meals of
women, and the law about drinking, that the sober shall be masters of
the feast; also the training of soldiers to acquire by practice equal skill
with both hands, so that one should be as useful as the other.)
Draco has left laws, but he adapted them to a constitution which
already existed, and there is no peculiarity in them which is worth mentioning, except the greatness and severity of the punishments.
Pittacus, too, was only a lawgiver, and not the author of a constitution; he has a law which is peculiar to him, that, if a drunken man do
something wrong, he shall be more heavily punished than if he were
sober; he looked not to the excuse which might be offered for the drunkard, but only to expediency, for drunken more often than sober people
commit acts of violence.
Androdamas of Rhegium gave laws to the Chalcidians of Thrace.
Some of them relate to homicide, and to heiresses; but there is nothing
remarkable in them.
And here let us conclude our inquiry into the various constitutions
which either actually exist, or have been devised by theorists.
BOOK THREE
Part I
He who would inquire into the essence and attributes of various kinds of
governments must first of all determine ‘What is a state?’ At present
this is a disputed question. Some say that the state has done a certain
act; others, no, not the state, but the oligarchy or the tyrant. And the
legislator or statesman is concerned entirely with the state; a constitution or government being an arrangement of the inhabitants of a state.
52/Aristotle
But a state is composite, like any other whole made up of many parts;
these are the citizens, who compose it. It is evident, therefore, that we
must begin by asking, Who is the citizen, and what is the meaning of the
term? For here again there may be a difference of opinion. He who is a
citizen in a democracy will often not be a citizen in an oligarchy. Leaving out of consideration those who have been made citizens, or who
have obtained the name of citizen any other accidental manner, we may
say, first, that a citizen is not a citizen because he lives in a certain
place, for resident aliens and slaves share in the place; nor is he a citizen
who has no legal right except that of suing and being sued; for this right
may be enjoyed under the provisions of a treaty. Nay, resident aliens in
many places do not possess even such rights completely, for they are
obliged to have a patron, so that they do but imperfectly participate in
citizenship, and we call them citizens only in a qualified sense, as we
might apply the term to children who are too young to be on the register,
or to old men who have been relieved from state duties. Of these we do
not say quite simply that they are citizens, but add in the one case that
they are not of age, and in the other, that they are past the age, or something of that sort; the precise expression is immaterial, for our meaning
is clear. Similar difficulties to those which I have mentioned may be
raised and answered about deprived citizens and about exiles. But the
citizen whom we are seeking to define is a citizen in the strictest sense,
against whom no such exception can be taken, and his special characteristic is that he shares in the administration of justice, and in offices.
Now of offices some are discontinuous, and the same persons are not
allowed to hold them twice, or can only hold them after a fixed interval;
others have no limit of time—for example, the office of a dicast or
ecclesiast. It may, indeed, be argued that these are not magistrates at all,
and that their functions give them no share in the government. But surely
it is ridiculous to say that those who have the power do not govern. Let
us not dwell further upon this, which is a purely verbal question; what
we want is a common term including both dicast and ecclesiast. Let us,
for the sake of distinction, call it ‘indefinite office,’ and we will assume
that those who share in such office are citizens. This is the most comprehensive definition of a citizen, and best suits all those who are generally so called.
But we must not forget that things of which the underlying principles differ in kind, one of them being first, another second, another
third, have, when regarded in this relation, nothing, or hardly anything,
Politics/53
worth mentioning in common. Now we see that governments differ in
kind, and that some of them are prior and that others are posterior; those
which are faulty or perverted are necessarily posterior to those which
are perfect. (What we mean by perversion will be hereafter explained.)
The citizen then of necessity differs under each form of government;
and our definition is best adapted to the citizen of a democracy; but not
necessarily to other states. For in some states the people are not acknowledged, nor have they any regular assembly, but only extraordinary ones; and suits are distributed by sections among the magistrates.
At Lacedaemon, for instance, the Ephors determine suits about contracts, which they distribute among themselves, while the elders are judges
of homicide, and other causes are decided by other magistrates. A similar principle prevails at Carthage; there certain magistrates decide all
causes. We may, indeed, modify our definition of the citizen so as to
include these states. In them it is the holder of a definite, not of an
indefinite office, who legislates and judges, and to some or all such
holders of definite offices is reserved the right of deliberating or judging
about some things or about all things. The conception of the citizen now
begins to clear up.
He who has the power to take part in the deliberative or judicial
administration of any state is said by us to be a citizens of that state;
and, speaking generally, a state is a body of citizens sufficing for the
purposes of life.
Part II
But in practice a citizen is defined to be one of whom both the parents
are citizens; others insist on going further back; say to two or three or
more ancestors. This is a short and practical definition but there are
some who raise the further question: How this third or fourth ancestor
came to be a citizen? Gorgias of Leontini, partly because he was in a
difficulty, partly in irony, said—‘Mortars are what is made by the mortar-makers, and the citizens of Larissa are those who are made by the
magistrates; for it is their trade to make Larissaeans.’ Yet the question is
really simple, for, if according to the definition just given they shared in
the government, they were citizens. This is a better definition than the
other. For the words, ‘born of a father or mother who is a citizen,’
cannot possibly apply to the first inhabitants or founders of a state.
There is a greater difficulty in the case of those who have been
made citizens after a revolution, as by Cleisthenes at Athens after the
54/Aristotle
expulsion of the tyrants, for he enrolled in tribes many metics, both
strangers and slaves. The doubt in these cases is, not who is, but whether
he who is ought to be a citizen; and there will still be a furthering the
state, whether a certain act is or is not an act of the state; for what ought
not to be is what is false. Now, there are some who hold office, and yet
ought not to hold office, whom we describe as ruling, but ruling unjustly. And the citizen was defined by the fact of his holding some kind
of rule or office—he who holds a judicial or legislative office fulfills our
definition of a citizen. It is evident, therefore, that the citizens about
whom the doubt has arisen must be called citizens.
Part III
Whether they ought to be so or not is a question which is bound up with
the previous inquiry. For a parallel question is raised respecting the
state, whether a certain act is or is not an act of the state; for example, in
the transition from an oligarchy or a tyranny to a democracy. In such
cases persons refuse to fulfill their contracts or any other obligations,
on the ground that the tyrant, and not the state, contracted them; they
argue that some constitutions are established by force, and not for the
sake of the common good. But this would apply equally to democracies,
for they too may be founded on violence, and then the acts of the democracy will be neither more nor less acts of the state in question than those
of an oligarchy or of a tyranny. This question runs up into another: on
what principle shall we ever say that the state is the same, or different?
It would be a very superficial view which considered only the place and
the inhabitants (for the soil and the population may be separated, and
some of the inhabitants may live in one place and some in another).
This, however, is not a very serious difficulty; we need only remark that
the word ‘state’ is ambiguous.
It is further asked: When are men, living in the same place, to be
regarded as a single city—what is the limit? Certainly not the wall of the
city, for you might surround all Peloponnesus with a wall. Like this, we
may say, is Babylon, and every city that has the compass of a nation
rather than a city; Babylon, they say, had been taken for three days
before some part of the inhabitants became aware of the fact. This difficulty may, however, with advantage be deferred to another occasion;
the statesman has to consider the size of the state, and whether it should
consist of more than one nation or not.
Again, shall we say that while the race of inhabitants, as well as
Politics/55
their place of abode, remain the same, the city is also the same, although
the citizens are always dying and being born, as we call rivers and fountains the same, although the water is always flowing away and coming
again Or shall we say that the generations of men, like the rivers, are the
same, but that the state changes? For, since the state is a partnership,
and is a partnership of citizens in a constitution, when the form of government changes, and becomes different, then it may be supposed that
the state is no longer the same, just as a tragic differs from a comic
chorus, although the members of both may be identical. And in this
manner we speak of every union or composition of elements as different
when the form of their composition alters; for example, a scale containing the same sounds is said to be different, accordingly as the Dorian or
the Phrygian mode is employed. And if this is true it is evident that the
sameness of the state consists chiefly in the sameness of the constitution, and it may be called or not called by the same name, whether the
inhabitants are the same or entirely different. It is quite another question, whether a state ought or ought not to fulfill engagements when the
form of government changes.
Part IV
There is a point nearly allied to the preceding: Whether the virtue of a
good man and a good citizen is the same or not. But, before entering on
this discussion, we must certainly first obtain some general notion of the
virtue of the citizen. Like the sailor, the citizen is a member of a community. Now, sailors have different functions, for one of them is a rower,
another a pilot, and a third a look-out man, a fourth is described by
some similar term; and while the precise definition of each individual’s
virtue applies exclusively to him, there is, at the same time, a common
definition applicable to them all. For they have all of them a common
object, which is safety in navigation. Similarly, one citizen differs from
another, but the salvation of the community is the common business of
them all. This community is the constitution; the virtue of the citizen
must therefore be relative to the constitution of which he is a member.
If, then, there are many forms of government, it is evident that there is
not one single virtue of the good citizen which is perfect virtue. But we
say that the good man is he who has one single virtue which is perfect
virtue. Hence it is evident that the good citizen need not of necessity
possess the virtue which makes a good man.
The same question may also be approached by another road, from a
56/Aristotle
consideration of the best constitution. If the state cannot be entirely
composed of good men, and yet each citizen is expected to do his own
business well, and must therefore have virtue, still inasmuch as all the
citizens cannot be alike, the virtue of the citizen and of the good man
cannot coincide. All must have the virtue of the good citizen—thus, and
thus only, can the state be perfect; but they will not have the virtue of a
good man, unless we assume that in the good state all the citizens must
be good.
Again, the state, as composed of unlikes, may be compared to the
living being: as the first elements into which a living being is resolved
are soul and body, as soul is made up of rational principle and appetite,
the family of husband and wife, property of master and slave, so of all
these, as well as other dissimilar elements, the state is composed; and,
therefore, the virtue of all the citizens cannot possibly be the same, any
more than the excellence of the leader of a chorus is the same as that of
the performer who stands by his side. I have said enough to show why
the two kinds of virtue cannot be absolutely and always the same.
But will there then be no case in which the virtue of the good citizen
and the virtue of the good man coincide? To this we answer that the
good ruler is a good and wise man, and that he who would be a statesman must be a wise man. And some persons say that even the education
of the ruler should be of a special kind; for are not the children of kings
instructed in riding and military exercises? As Euripides says:
“No subtle arts for me, but what the state requires.”
As though there were a special education needed by a ruler. If then
the virtue of a good ruler is the same as that of a good man, and we
assume further that the subject is a citizen as well as the ruler, the virtue
of the good citizen and the virtue of the good man cannot be absolutely
the same, although in some cases they may; for the virtue of a ruler
differs from that of a citizen. It was the sense of this difference which
made Jason say that ‘he felt hungry when he was not a tyrant,’ meaning
that he could not endure to live in a private station. But, on the other
hand, it may be argued that men are praised for knowing both how to
rule and how to obey, and he is said to be a citizen of approved virtue
who is able to do both. Now if we suppose the virtue of a good man to be
that which rules, and the virtue of the citizen to include ruling and obeying, it cannot be said that they are equally worthy of praise. Since, then,
Politics/57
it is sometimes thought that the ruler and the ruled must learn different
things and not the same, but that the citizen must know and share in
them both, the inference is obvious. There is, indeed, the rule of a master, which is concerned with menial offices—the master need not know
how to perform these, but may employ others in the execution of them:
the other would be degrading; and by the other I mean the power actually to do menial duties, which vary much in character and are executed
by various classes of slaves, such, for example, as handicraftsmen, who,
as their name signifies, live by the labor of their hands: under these the
mechanic is included. Hence in ancient times, and among some nations,
the working classes had no share in the government—a privilege which
they only acquired under the extreme democracy. Certainly the good
man and the statesman and the good citizen ought not to learn the crafts
of inferiors except for their own occasional use; if they habitually practice them, there will cease to be a distinction between master and slave.
This is not the rule of which we are speaking; but there is a rule of
another kind, which is exercised over freemen and equals by birth—a
constitutional rule, which the ruler must learn by obeying, as he would
learn the duties of a general of cavalry by being under the orders of a
general of cavalry, or the duties of a general of infantry by being under
the orders of a general of infantry, and by having had the command of a
regiment and of a company. It has been well said that ‘he who has never
learned to obey cannot be a good commander.’ The two are not the
same, but the good citizen ought to be capable of both; he should know
how to govern like a freeman, and how to obey like a freeman—these
are the virtues of a citizen. And, although the temperance and justice of
a ruler are distinct from those of a subject, the virtue of a good man will
include both; for the virtue of the good man who is free and also a
subject, e.g., his justice, will not be one but will comprise distinct kinds,
the one qualifying him to rule, the other to obey, and differing as the
temperance and courage of men and women differ. For a man would be
thought a coward if he had no more courage than a courageous woman,
and a woman would be thought loquacious if she imposed no more restraint on her conversation than the good man; and indeed their part in
the management of the household is different, for the duty of the one is
to acquire, and of the other to preserve. Practical wisdom only is characteristic of the ruler: it would seem that all other virtues must equally
belong to ruler and subject. The virtue of the subject is certainly not
wisdom, but only true opinion; he may be compared to the maker of the
58/Aristotle
flute, while his master is like the flute-player or user of the flute.
From these considerations may be gathered the answer to the question, whether the virtue of the good man is the same as that of the good
citizen, or different, and how far the same, and how far different.
Part V
There still remains one more question about the citizen: Is he only a true
citizen who has a share of office, or is the mechanic to be included? If
they who hold no office are to be deemed citizens, not every citizen can
have this virtue of ruling and obeying; for this man is a citizen And if
none of the lower class are citizens, in which part of the state are they to
be placed? For they are not resident aliens, and they are not foreigners.
May we not reply, that as far as this objection goes there is no more
absurdity in excluding them than in excluding slaves and freedmen from
any of the above-mentioned classes? It must be admitted that we cannot
consider all those to be citizens who are necessary to the existence of the
state; for example, children are not citizen equally with grown-up men,
who are citizens absolutely, but children, not being grown up, are only
citizens on a certain assumption. Nay, in ancient times, and among some
nations the artisan class were slaves or foreigners, and therefore the
majority of them are so now. The best form of state will not admit them
to citizenship; but if they are admitted, then our definition of the virtue
of a citizen will not apply to every citizen nor to every free man as such,
but only to those who are freed from necessary services. The necessary
people are either slaves who minister to the wants of individuals, or
mechanics and laborers who are the servants of the community. These
reflections carried a little further will explain their position; and indeed
what has been said already is of itself, when understood, explanation
enough.
Since there are many forms of government there must be many varieties of citizen and especially of citizens who are subjects; so that
under some governments the mechanic and the laborer will be citizens,
but not in others, as, for example, in aristocracy or the so-called government of the best (if there be such an one), in which honors are given
according to virtue and merit; for no man can practice virtue who is
living the life of a mechanic or laborer. In oligarchies the qualification
for office is high, and therefore no laborer can ever be a citizen; but a
mechanic may, for an actual majority of them are rich. At Thebes there
was a law that no man could hold office who had not retired from busi-
Politics/59
ness for ten years. But in many states the law goes to the length of
admitting aliens; for in some democracies a man is a citizen though his
mother only be a citizen; and a similar principle is applied to illegitimate
children; the law is relaxed when there is a dearth of population. But
when the number of citizens increases, first the children of a male or a
female slave are excluded; then those whose mothers only are citizens;
and at last the right of citizenship is confined to those whose fathers and
mothers are both citizens.
Hence, as is evident, there are different kinds of citizens; and he is a
citizen in the highest sense who shares in the honors of the state. Compare Homer’s words, ‘like some dishonored stranger’; he who is excluded from the honors of the state is no better than an alien. But when
his exclusion is concealed, then the object is that the privileged class
may deceive their fellow inhabitants.
As to the question whether the virtue of the good man is the same as
that of the good citizen, the considerations already adduced prove that
in some states the good man and the good citizen are the same, and in
others different. When they are the same it is not every citizen who is a
good man, but only the statesman and those who have or may have,
alone or in conjunction with others, the conduct of public affairs.
Part VI
Having determined these questions, we have next to consider whether
there is only one form of government or many, and if many, what they
are, and how many, and what are the differences between them.
A constitution is the arrangement of magistracies in a state, especially of the highest of all. The government is everywhere sovereign in
the state, and the constitution is in fact the government. For example, in
democracies the people are supreme, but in oligarchies, the few; and,
therefore, we say that these two forms of government also are different:
and so in other cases.
First, let us consider what is the purpose of a state, and how many
forms of government there are by which human society is regulated. We
have already said, in the first part of this treatise, when discussing household management and the rule of a master, that man is by nature a
political animal. And therefore, men, even when they do not require one
another’s help, desire to live together; not but that they are also brought
together by their common interests in proportion as they severally attain
to any measure of well-being. This is certainly the chief end, both of
60/Aristotle
individuals and of states. And also for the sake of mere life (in which
there is possibly some noble element so long as the evils of existence do
not greatly overbalance the good) mankind meet together and maintain
the political community. And we all see that men cling to life even at the
cost of enduring great misfortune, seeming to find in life a natural sweetness and happiness.
There is no difficulty in distinguishing the various kinds of authority; they have been often defined already in discussions outside the school.
The rule of a master, although the slave by nature and the master by
nature have in reality the same interests, is nevertheless exercised primarily with a view to the interest of the master, but accidentally considers the slave, since, if the slave perish, the rule of the master perishes
with him. On the other hand, the government of a wife and children and
of a household, which we have called household management, is exercised in the first instance for the good of the governed or for the common good of both parties, but essentially for the good of the governed,
as we see to be the case in medicine, gymnastic, and the arts in general,
which are only accidentally concerned with the good of the artists themselves. For there is no reason why the trainer may not sometimes practice gymnastics, and the helmsman is always one of the crew. The trainer
or the helmsman considers the good of those committed to his care. But,
when he is one of the persons taken care of, he accidentally participates
in the advantage, for the helmsman is also a sailor, and the trainer becomes one of those in training. And so in politics: when the state is
framed upon the principle of equality and likeness, the citizens think
that they ought to hold office by turns. Formerly, as is natural, every one
would take his turn of service; and then again, somebody else would
look after his interest, just as he, while in office, had looked after theirs.
But nowadays, for the sake of the advantage which is to be gained from
the public revenues and from office, men want to be always in office.
One might imagine that the rulers, being sickly, were only kept in health
while they continued in office; in that case we may be sure that they
would be hunting after places. The conclusion is evident: that governments which have a regard to the common interest are constituted in
accordance with strict principles of justice, and are therefore true forms;
but those which regard only the interest of the rulers are all defective
and perverted forms, for they are despotic, whereas a state is a community of freemen.
Politics/61
Part VII
Having determined these points, we have next to consider how many
forms of government there are, and what they are; and in the first place
what are the true forms, for when they are determined the perversions of
them will at once be apparent. The words constitution and government
have the same meaning, and the government, which is the supreme authority in states, must be in the hands of one, or of a few, or of the many.
The true forms of government, therefore, are those in which the one, or
the few, or the many, govern with a view to the common interest; but
governments which rule with a view to the private interest, whether of
the one or of the few, or of the many, are perversions. For the members
of a state, if they are truly citizens, ought to participate in its advantages. Of forms of government in which one rules, we call that which
regards the common interests, kingship or royalty; that in which more
than one, but not many, rule, aristocracy; and it is so called, either because the rulers are the best men, or because they have at heart the best
interests of the state and of the citizens. But when the citizens at large
administer the state for the common interest, the government is called
by the generic name—a constitution. And there is a reason for this use
of language. One man or a few may excel in virtue; but as the number
increases it becomes more difficult for them to attain perfection in every
kind of virtue, though they may in military virtue, for this is found in the
masses. Hence in a constitutional government the fighting-men have the
supreme power, and those who possess arms are the citizens.
Of the above-mentioned forms, the perversions are as follows: of
royalty, tyranny; of aristocracy, oligarchy; of constitutional government,
democracy. For tyranny is a kind of monarchy which has in view the
interest of the monarch only; oligarchy has in view the interest of the
wealthy; democracy, of the needy: none of them the common good of
all.
Part VIII
But there are difficulties about these forms of government, and it will
therefore be necessary to state a little more at length the nature of each
of them. For he who would make a philosophical study of the various
sciences, and does not regard practice only, ought not to overlook or
omit anything, but to set forth the truth in every particular. Tyranny, as
I was saying, is monarchy exercising the rule of a master over the political society; oligarchy is when men of property have the government in
62/Aristotle
their hands; democracy, the opposite, when the indigent, and not the
men of property, are the rulers. And here arises the first of our difficulties, and it relates to the distinction drawn. For democracy is said to be
the government of the many. But what if the many are men of property
and have the power in their hands? In like manner oligarchy is said to be
the government of the few; but what if the poor are fewer than the rich,
and have the power in their hands because they are stronger? In these
cases the distinction which we have drawn between these different forms
of government would no longer hold good.
Suppose, once more, that we add wealth to the few and poverty to
the many, and name the governments accordingly—an oligarchy is said
to be that in which the few and the wealthy, and a democracy that in
which the many and the poor are the rulers—there will still be a difficulty. For, if the only forms of government are the ones already mentioned, how shall we describe those other governments also just mentioned by us, in which the rich are the more numerous and the poor are
the fewer, and both govern in their respective states?
The argument seems to show that, whether in oligarchies or in democracies, the number of the governing body, whether the greater number, as in a democracy, or the smaller number, as in an oligarchy, is an
accident due to the fact that the rich everywhere are few, and the poor
numerous. But if so, there is a misapprehension of the causes of the
difference between them. For the real difference between democracy
and oligarchy is poverty and wealth. Wherever men rule by reason of
their wealth, whether they be few or many, that is an oligarchy, and
where the poor rule, that is a democracy. But as a fact the rich are few
and the poor many; for few are well-to-do, whereas freedom is enjoyed
by an, and wealth and freedom are the grounds on which the oligarchical and democratical parties respectively claim power in the state.
Part IX
Let us begin by considering the common definitions of oligarchy and
democracy, and what is justice oligarchical and democratical. For all
men cling to justice of some kind, but their conceptions are imperfect
and they do not express the whole idea. For example, justice is thought
by them to be, and is, equality, not. however, for however, for but only
for equals. And inequality is thought to be, and is, justice; neither is this
for all, but only for unequals. When the persons are omitted, then men
judge erroneously. The reason is that they are passing judgment on them-
Politics/63
selves, and most people are bad judges in their own case. And whereas
justice implies a relation to persons as well as to things, and a just
distribution, as I have already said in the Ethics, implies the same ratio
between the persons and between the things, they agree about the equality of the things, but dispute about the equality of the persons, chiefly
for the reason which I have just given—because they are bad judges in
their own affairs; and secondly, because both the parties to the argument are speaking of a limited and partial justice, but imagine themselves to be speaking of absolute justice. For the one party, if they are
unequal in one respect, for example wealth, consider themselves to be
unequal in all; and the other party, if they are equal in one respect, for
example free birth, consider themselves to be equal in all. But they leave
out the capital point. For if men met and associated out of regard to
wealth only, their share in the state would be proportioned to their property, and the oligarchical doctrine would then seem to carry the day. It
would not be just that he who paid one mina should have the same share
of a hundred minae, whether of the principal or of the profits, as he who
paid the remaining ninety-nine. But a state exists for the sake of a good
life, and not for the sake of life only: if life only were the object, slaves
and brute animals might form a state, but they cannot, for they have no
share in happiness or in a life of free choice. Nor does a state exist for
the sake of alliance and security from injustice, nor yet for the sake of
exchange and mutual intercourse; for then the Tyrrhenians and the
Carthaginians, and all who have commercial treaties with one another,
would be the citizens of one state. True, they have agreements about
imports, and engagements that they will do no wrong to one another,
and written articles of alliance. But there are no magistrates common to
the contracting parties who will enforce their engagements; different
states have each their own magistracies. Nor does one state take care
that the citizens of the other are such as they ought to be, nor see that
those who come under the terms of the treaty do no wrong or wickedness at an, but only that they do no injustice to one another. Whereas,
those who care for good government take into consideration virtue and
vice in states. Whence it may be further inferred that virtue must be the
care of a state which is truly so called, and not merely enjoys the name:
for without this end the community becomes a mere alliance which differs only in place from alliances of which the members live apart; and
law is only a convention, ‘a surety to one another of justice,’ as the
sophist Lycophron says, and has no real power to make the citizens
64/Aristotle
This is obvious; for suppose distinct places, such as Corinth and
Megara, to be brought together so that their walls touched, still they
would not be one city, not even if the citizens had the right to intermarry,
which is one of the rights peculiarly characteristic of states. Again, if
men dwelt at a distance from one another, but not so far off as to have
no intercourse, and there were laws among them that they should not
wrong each other in their exchanges, neither would this be a state. Let
us suppose that one man is a carpenter, another a husbandman, another
a shoemaker, and so on, and that their number is ten thousand: nevertheless, if they have nothing in common but exchange, alliance, and the
like, that would not constitute a state. Why is this? Surely not because
they are at a distance from one another: for even supposing that such a
community were to meet in one place, but that each man had a house of
his own, which was in a manner his state, and that they made alliance
with one another, but only against evil-doers; still an accurate thinker
would not deem this to be a state, if their intercourse with one another
was of the same character after as before their union. It is clear then that
a state is not a mere society, having a common place, established for the
prevention of mutual crime and for the sake of exchange. These are
conditions without which a state cannot exist; but all of them together
do not constitute a state, which is a community of families and aggregations of families in well-being, for the sake of a perfect and self-sufficing life. Such a community can only be established among those who
live in the same place and intermarry. Hence arise in cities family connections, brotherhoods, common sacrifices, amusements which draw
men together. But these are created by friendship, for the will to live
together is friendship. The end of the state is the good life, and these are
the means towards it. And the state is the union of families and villages
in a perfect and self-sufficing life, by which we mean a happy and honorable life.
Our conclusion, then, is that political society exists for the sake of
noble actions, and not of mere companionship. Hence they who contribute most to such a society have a greater share in it than those who have
the same or a greater freedom or nobility of birth but are inferior to
them in political virtue; or than those who exceed them in wealth but are
surpassed by them in virtue.
From what has been said it will be clearly seen that all the partisans
of different forms of government speak of a part of justice only.
Politics/65
Part X
There is also a doubt as to what is to be the supreme power in the state:
Is it the multitude? Or the wealthy? Or the good? Or the one best man?
Or a tyrant? Any of these alternatives seems to involve disagreeable
consequences. If the poor, for example, because they are more in number, divide among themselves the property of the rich—is not this unjust? No, by heaven (will be the reply), for the supreme authority justly
willed it. But if this is not injustice, pray what is? Again, when in the
first division all has been taken, and the majority divide anew the property of the minority, is it not evident, if this goes on, that they will ruin
the state? Yet surely, virtue is not the ruin of those who possess her, nor
is justice destructive of a state; and therefore this law of confiscation
clearly cannot be just. If it were, all the acts of a tyrant must of necessity
be just; for he only coerces other men by superior power, just as the
multitude coerce the rich. But is it just then that the few and the wealthy
should be the rulers? And what if they, in like manner, rob and plunder
the people—is this just? if so, the other case will likewise be just. But
there can be no doubt that all these things are wrong and unjust.
Then ought the good to rule and have supreme power? But in that
case everybody else, being excluded from power, will be dishonored.
For the offices of a state are posts of honor; and if one set of men always
holds them, the rest must be deprived of them. Then will it be well that
the one best man should rule? Nay, that is still more oligarchical, for the
number of those who are dishonored is thereby increased. Some one
may say that it is bad in any case for a man, subject as he is to all the
accidents of human passion, to have the supreme power, rather than the
law. But what if the law itself be democratical or oligarchical, how will
that help us out of our difficulties? Not at all; the same consequences
will follow.
Part XI
Most of these questions may be reserved for another occasion. The principle that the multitude ought to be supreme rather than the few best is
one that is maintained, and, though not free from difficulty, yet seems to
contain an element of truth. For the many, of whom each individual is
but an ordinary person, when they meet together may very likely be
better than the few good, if regarded not individually but collectively,
just as a feast to which many contribute is better than a dinner provided
out of a single purse. For each individual among the many has a share of
66/Aristotle
virtue and prudence, and when they meet together, they become in a
manner one man, who has many feet, and hands, and senses; that is a
figure of their mind and disposition. Hence the many are better judges
than a single man of music and poetry; for some understand one part,
and some another, and among them they understand the whole. There is
a similar combination of qualities in good men, who differ from any
individual of the many, as the beautiful are said to differ from those who
are not beautiful, and works of art from realities, because in them the
scattered elements are combined, although, if taken separately, the eye
of one person or some other feature in another person would be fairer
than in the picture. Whether this principle can apply to every democracy, and to all bodies of men, is not clear. Or rather, by heaven, in some
cases it is impossible of application; for the argument would equally
hold about brutes; and wherein, it will be asked, do some men differ
from brutes? But there may be bodies of men about whom our statement
is nevertheless true. And if so, the difficulty which has been already
raised, and also another which is akin to it—viz., what power should be
assigned to the mass of freemen and citizens, who are not rich and have
no personal merit—are both solved. There is still a danger in aflowing
them to share the great offices of state, for their folly will lead them into
error, and their dishonesty into crime. But there is a danger also in not
letting them share, for a state in which many poor men are excluded
from office will necessarily be full of enemies. The only way of escape
is to assign to them some deliberative and judicial functions. For this
reason Solon and certain other legislators give them the power of electing to offices, and of calling the magistrates to account, but they do not
allow them to hold office singly. When they meet together their perceptions are quite good enough, and combined with the better class they are
useful to the state (just as impure food when mixed with what is pure
sometimes makes the entire mass more wholesome than a small quantity
of the pure would be), but each individual, left to himself, forms an
imperfect judgment. On the other hand, the popular form of government
involves certain difficulties. In the first place, it might be objected that
he who can judge of the healing of a sick man would be one who could
himself heal his disease, and make him whole—that is, in other words,
the physician; and so in all professions and arts. As, then, the physician
ought to be called to account by physicians, so ought men in general to
be called to account by their peers. But physicians are of three kinds:
there is the ordinary practitioner, and there is the physician of the higher
Politics/67
class, and thirdly the intelligent man who has studied the art: in all arts
there is such a class; and we attribute the power of judging to them quite
as much as to professors of the art. Secondly, does not the same principle apply to elections? For a right election can only be made by those
who have knowledge; those who know geometry, for example, will choose
a geometrician rightly, and those who know how to steer, a pilot; and,
even if there be some occupations and arts in which private persons
share in the ability to choose, they certainly cannot choose better than
those who know. So that, according to this argument, neither the election of magistrates, nor the calling of them to account, should be entrusted to the many. Yet possibly these objections are to a great extent
met by our old answer, that if the people are not utterly degraded, although individually they may be worse judges than those who have special knowledge—as a body they are as good or better. Moreover, there
are some arts whose products are not judged of solely, or best, by the
artists themselves, namely those arts whose products are recognized
even by those who do not possess the art; for example, the knowledge of
the house is not limited to the builder only; the user, or, in other words,
the master, of the house will be even a better judge than the builder, just
as the pilot will judge better of a rudder than the carpenter, and the guest
will judge better of a feast than the cook.
This difficulty seems now to be sufficiently answered, but there is
another akin to it. That inferior persons should have authority in greater
matters than the good would appear to be a strange thing, yet the election and calling to account of the magistrates is the greatest of all. And
these, as I was saying, are functions which in some states are assigned
to the people, for the assembly is supreme in all such matters. Yet persons of any age, and having but a small property qualification, sit in the
assembly and deliberate and judge, although for the great officers of
state, such as treasurers and generals, a high qualification is required.
This difficulty may be solved in the same manner as the preceding, and
the present practice of democracies may be really defensible. For the
power does not reside in the dicast, or senator, or ecclesiast, but in the
court, and the senate, and the assembly, of which individual senators, or
ecclesiasts, or dicasts, are only parts or members. And for this reason
the many may claim to have a higher authority than the few; for the
people, and the senate, and the courts consist of many persons, and their
property collectively is greater than the property of one or of a few
individuals holding great offices. But enough of this.
68/Aristotle
The discussion of the first question shows nothing so clearly as that
laws, when good, should be supreme; and that the magistrate or magistrates should regulate those matters only on which the laws are unable
to speak with precision owing to the difficulty of any general principle
embracing all particulars. But what are good laws has not yet been
clearly explained; the old difficulty remains. The goodness or badness,
justice or injustice, of laws varies of necessity with the constitutions of
states. This, however, is clear, that the laws must be adapted to the
constitutions. But if so, true forms of government will of necessity have
just laws, and perverted forms of government will have unjust laws.
Part XII
In all sciences and arts the end is a good, and the greatest good and in
the highest degree a good in the most authoritative of all—this is the
political science of which the good is justice, in other words, the common interest. All men think justice to be a sort of equality; and to a
certain extent they agree in the philosophical distinctions which have
been laid down by us about Ethics. For they admit that justice is a thing
and has a relation to persons, and that equals ought to have equality.
But there still remains a question: equality or inequality of what? Here
is a difficulty which calls for political speculation. For very likely some
persons will say that offices of state ought to be unequally distributed
according to superior excellence, in whatever respect, of the citizen,
although there is no other difference between him and the rest of the
community; for that those who differ in any one respect have different
rights and claims. But, surely, if this is true, the complexion or height of
a man, or any other advantage, will be a reason for his obtaining a
greater share of political rights. The error here lies upon the surface,
and may be illustrated from the other arts and sciences. When a number
of flute players are equal in their art, there is no reason why those of
them who are better born should have better flutes given to them; for
they will not play any better on the flute, and the superior instrument
should be reserved for him who is the superior artist. If what I am saying is still obscure, it will be made clearer as we proceed. For if there
were a superior flute-player who was far inferior in birth and beauty,
although either of these may be a greater good than the art of fluteplaying, and may excel flute-playing in a greater ratio than he excels the
others in his art, still he ought to have the best flutes given to him, unless
the advantages of wealth and birth contribute to excellence in flute-
Politics/69
playing, which they do not. Moreover, upon this principle any good may
be compared with any other. For if a given height may be measured
wealth and against freedom, height in general may be so measured. Thus
if A excels in height more than B in virtue, even if virtue in general
excels height still more, all goods will be commensurable; for if a certain amount is better than some other, it is clear that some other will be
equal. But since no such comparison can be made, it is evident that there
is good reason why in politics men do not ground their claim to office on
every sort of inequality any more than in the arts. For if some be slow,
and others swift, that is no reason why the one should have little and the
others much; it is in gymnastics contests that such excellence is rewarded.
Whereas the rival claims of candidates for office can only be based on
the possession of elements which enter into the composition of a state.
And therefore the noble, or free-born, or rich, may with good reason
claim office; for holders of offices must be freemen and taxpayers: a
state can be no more composed entirely of poor men than entirely of
slaves. But if wealth and freedom are necessary elements, justice and
valor are equally so; for without the former qualities a state cannot exist
at all, without the latter not well.
Part XIII
If the existence of the state is alone to be considered, then it would seem
that all, or some at least, of these claims are just; but, if we take into
account a good life, then, as I have already said, education and virtue
have superior claims. As, however, those who are equal in one thing
ought not to have an equal share in all, nor those who are unequal in one
thing to have an unequal share in all, it is certain that all forms of government which rest on either of these principles are perversions. All men
have a claim in a certain sense, as I have already admitted, but all have
not an absolute claim. The rich claim because they have a greater share
in the land, and land is the common element of the state; also they are
generally more trustworthy in contracts. The free claim under the same
tide as the noble; for they are nearly akin. For the noble are citizens in a
truer sense than the ignoble, and good birth is always valued in a man’s
own home and country. Another reason is, that those who are sprung
from better ancestors are likely to be better men, for nobility is excellence of race. Virtue, too, may be truly said to have a claim, for justice
has been acknowledged by us to be a social virtue, and it implies all
others. Again, the many may urge their claim against the few; for, when
70/Aristotle
taken collectively, and compared with the few, they are stronger and
richer and better. But, what if the good, the rich, the noble, and the other
classes who make up a state, are all living together in the same city, Will
there, or will there not, be any doubt who shall rule? No doubt at all in
determining who ought to rule in each of the above-mentioned forms of
government. For states are characterized by differences in their governing bodies-one of them has a government of the rich, another of the
virtuous, and so on. But a difficulty arises when all these elements coexist. How are we to decide? Suppose the virtuous to be very few in
number: may we consider their numbers in relation to their duties, and
ask whether they are enough to administer the state, or so many as will
make up a state? Objections may be urged against all the aspirants to
political power. For those who found their claims on wealth or family
might be thought to have no basis of justice; on this principle, if any one
person were richer than all the rest, it is clear that he ought to be ruler of
them. In like manner he who is very distinguished by his birth ought to
have the superiority over all those who claim on the ground that they are
freeborn. In an aristocracy, or government of the best, a like difficulty
occurs about virtue; for if one citizen be better than the other members
of the government, however good they may be, he too, upon the same
principle of justice, should rule over them. And if the people are to be
supreme because they are stronger than the few, then if one man, or
more than one, but not a majority, is stronger than the many, they ought
to rule, and not the many.
All these considerations appear to show that none of the principles
on which men claim to rule and to hold all other men in subjection to
them are strictly right. To those who claim to be masters of the government on the ground of their virtue or their wealth, the many might fairly
answer that they themselves are often better and richer than the few—I
do not say individually, but collectively. And another ingenious objection which is sometimes put forward may be met in a similar manner.
Some persons doubt whether the legislator who desires to make the justest
laws ought to legislate with a view to the good of the higher classes or of
the many, when the case which we have mentioned occurs. Now what is
just or right is to be interpreted in the sense of ‘what is equal’; and that
which is right in the sense of being equal is to be considered with reference to the advantage of the state, and the common good of the citizens.
And a citizen is one who shares in governing and being governed. He
differs under different forms of government, but in the best state he is
Politics/71
one who is able and willing to be governed and to govern with a view to
the life of virtue.
If, however, there be some one person, or more than one, although
not enough to make up the full complement of a state, whose virtue is so
pre-eminent that the virtues or the political capacity of all the rest admit
of no comparison with his or theirs, he or they can be no longer regarded
as part of a state; for justice will not be done to the superior, if he is
reckoned only as the equal of those who are so far inferior to him in
virtue and in political capacity. Such an one may truly be deemed a God
among men. Hence we see that legislation is necessarily concerned only
with those who are equal in birth and in capacity; and that for men of
pre-eminent virtue there is no law—they are themselves a law. Any would
be ridiculous who attempted to make laws for them: they would probably retort what, in the fable of Antisthenes, the lions said to the hares,
when in the council of the beasts the latter began haranguing and claiming equality for all. And for this reason democratic states have instituted
ostracism; equality is above all things their aim, and therefore they ostracized and banished from the city for a time those who seemed to
predominate too much through their wealth, or the number of their friends,
or through any other political influence. Mythology tells us that the
Argonauts left Heracles behind for a similar reason; the ship Argo would
not take him because she feared that he would have been too much for
the rest of the crew. Wherefore those who denounce tyranny and blame
the counsel which Periander gave to Thrasybulus cannot be held altogether just in their censure. The story is that Periander, when the herald
was sent to ask counsel of him, said nothing, but only cut off the tallest
ears of corn till he had brought the field to a level. The herald did not
know the meaning of the action, but came and reported what he had seen
to Thrasybulus, who understood that he was to cut off the principal men
in the state; and this is a policy not only expedient for tyrants or in
practice confined to them, but equally necessary in oligarchies and democracies. Ostracism is a measure of the same kind, which acts by
disabling and banishing the most prominent citizens. Great powers do
the same to whole cities and nations, as the Athenians did to the Samians,
Chians, and Lesbians; no sooner had they obtained a firm grasp of the
empire, than they humbled their allies contrary to treaty; and the Persian king has repeatedly crushed the Medes, Babylonians, and other
nations, when their spirit has been stirred by the recollection of their
former greatness.
72/Aristotle
The problem is a universal one, and equally concerns all forms of
government, true as well as false; for, although perverted forms with a
view to their own interests may adopt this policy, those which seek the
common interest do so likewise. The same thing may be observed in the
arts and sciences; for the painter will not allow the figure to have a foot
which, however beautiful, is not in proportion, nor will the shipbuilder
allow the stem or any other part of the vessel to be unduly large, any
more than the chorus-master will allow any one who sings louder or
better than all the rest to sing in the choir. Monarchs, too, may practice
compulsion and still live in harmony with their cities, if their own government is for the interest of the state. Hence where there is an acknowledged superiority the argument in favor of ostracism is based upon a
kind of political justice. It would certainly be better that the legislator
should from the first so order his state as to have no need of such a
remedy. But if the need arises, the next best thing is that he should
endeavor to correct the evil by this or some similar measure. The principle, however, has not been fairly applied in states; for, instead of looking to the good of their own constitution, they have used ostracism for
factious purposes. It is true that under perverted forms of government,
and from their special point of view, such a measure is just and expedient, but it is also clear that it is not absolutely just. In the perfect state
there would be great doubts about the use of it, not when applied to
excess in strength, wealth, popularity, or the like, but when used against
some one who is pre-eminent in virtue—what is to be done with him?
Mankind will not say that such an one is to be expelled and exiled; on
the other hand, he ought not to be a subject—that would be as if mankind should claim to rule over Zeus, dividing his offices among them.
The only alternative is that all should joyfully obey such a ruler, according to what seems to be the order of nature, and that men like him should
be kings in their state for life.
Part XIV
The preceding discussion, by a natural transition, leads to the consideration of royalty, which we admit to be one of the true forms of government. Let us see whether in order to be well governed a state or country
should be under the rule of a king or under some other form of government; and whether monarchy, although good for some, may not be bad
for others. But first we must determine whether there is one species of
royalty or many. It is easy to see that there are many, and that the man-
Politics/73
ner of government is not the same in all of them.
Of royalties according to law, (1) the Lacedaemonian is thought to
answer best to the true pattern; but there the royal power is not absolute,
except when the kings go on an expedition, and then they take the command. Matters of religion are likewise committed to them. The kingly
office is in truth a kind of generalship, irresponsible and perpetual. The
king has not the power of life and death, except in a specified case, as
for instance, in ancient times, he had it when upon a campaign, by right
of force. This custom is described in Homer. For Agamemnon is patient
when he is attacked in the assembly, but when the army goes out to
battle he has the power even of life and death. Does he not say—‘When
I find a man skulking apart from the battle, nothing shall save him from
the dogs and vultures, for in my hands is death’?
This, then, is one form of royalty—a generalship for life: and of
such royalties some are hereditary and others elective.
(2) There is another sort of monarchy not uncommon among the
barbarians, which nearly resembles tyranny. But this is both legal and
hereditary. For barbarians, being more servile in character than Hellenes,
and Asiadics than Europeans, do not rebel against a despotic government. Such royalties have the nature of tyrannies because the people are
by nature slaves; but there is no danger of their being overthrown, for
they are hereditary and legal. Wherefore also their guards are such as a
king and not such as a tyrant would employ, that is to say, they are
composed of citizens, whereas the guards of tyrants are mercenaries.
For kings rule according to law over voluntary subjects, but tyrants
over involuntary; and the one are guarded by their fellow-citizens the
others are guarded against them.
These are two forms of monarchy, and there was a third (3) which
existed in ancient Hellas, called an Aesymnetia or dictatorship. This
may be defined generally as an elective tyranny, which, like the barbarian monarchy, is legal, but differs from it in not being hereditary. Sometimes the office was held for life, sometimes for a term of years, or until
certain duties had been performed. For example, the Mytilenaeans elected
Pittacus leader against the exiles, who were headed by Antimenides and
Alcaeus the poet. And Alcaeus himself shows in one of his banquet odes
that they chose Pittacus tyrant, for he reproaches his fellow-citizens for
‘having made the low-born Pittacus tyrant of the spiritless and ill-fated
city, with one voice shouting his praises.’
These forms of government have always had the character of tyran-
74/Aristotle
nies, because they possess despotic power; but inasmuch as they are
elective and acquiesced in by their subjects, they are kingly.
(4) There is a fourth species of kingly rule—that of the heroic times—
which was hereditary and legal, and was exercised over willing subjects. For the first chiefs were benefactors of the people in arts or arms;
they either gathered them into a community, or procured land for them;
and thus they became kings of voluntary subjects, and their power was
inherited by their descendants. They took the command in war and presided over the sacrifices, except those which required a priest. They
also decided causes either with or without an oath; and when they swore,
the form of the oath was the stretching out of their sceptre. In ancient
times their power extended continuously to all things whatsoever, in city
and country, as well as in foreign parts; but at a later date they relinquished several of these privileges, and others the people took from
them, until in some states nothing was left to them but the sacrifices;
and where they retained more of the reality they had only the right of
leadership in war beyond the border.
These, then, are the four kinds of royalty. First the monarchy of the
heroic ages; this was exercised over voluntary subjects, but limited to
certain functions; the king was a general and a judge, and had the control of religion The second is that of the barbarians, which is a hereditary despotic government in accordance with law. A third is the power
of the so-called Aesynmete or Dictator; this is an elective tyranny. The
fourth is the Lacedaemonian, which is in fact a generalship, hereditary
and perpetual. These four forms differ from one another in the manner
which I have described.
(5) There is a fifth form of kingly rule in which one has the disposal
of all, just as each nation or each state has the disposal of public matters; this form corresponds to the control of a household. For as household management is the kingly rule of a house, so kingly rule is the
household management of a city, or of a nation, or of many nations.
Part XV
Of these forms we need only consider two, the Lacedaemonian and the
absolute royalty; for most of the others he in a region between them,
having less power than the last, and more than the first. Thus the inquiry
is reduced to two points: first, is it advantageous to the state that there
should be a perpetual general, and if so, should the office be confined to
one family, or open to the citizens in turn? Secondly, is it well that a
Politics/75
single man should have the supreme power in all things? The first question falls under the head of laws rather than of constitutions; for perpetual generalship might equally exist under any form of government,
so that this matter may be dismissed for the present. The other kind of
royalty is a sort of constitution; this we have now to consider, and briefly
to run over the difficulties involved in it. We will begin by inquiring
whether it is more advantageous to be ruled by the best man or by the
best laws.
The advocates of royalty maintain that the laws speak only in general terms, and cannot provide for circumstances; and that for any science to abide by written rules is absurd. In Egypt the physician is allowed to alter his treatment after the fourth day, but if sooner, he takes
the risk. Hence it is clear that a government acting according to written
laws is plainly not the best. Yet surely the ruler cannot dispense with the
general principle which exists in law; and this is a better ruler which is
free from passion than that in which it is innate. Whereas the law is
passionless, passion must ever sway the heart of man. Yes, it may be
replied, but then on the other hand an individual will be better able to
deliberate in particular cases.
The best man, then, must legislate, and laws must be passed, but
these laws will have no authority when they miss the mark, though in all
other cases retaining their authority. But when the law cannot determine
a point at all, or not well, should the one best man or should all decide?
According to our present practice assemblies meet, sit in judgment, deliberate, and decide, and their judgments an relate to individual cases.
Now any member of the assembly, taken separately, is certainly inferior
to the wise man. But the state is made up of many individuals. And as a
feast to which all the guests contribute is better than a banquet furnished by a single man, so a multitude is a better judge of many things
than any individual.
Again, the many are more incorruptible than the few; they are like
the greater quantity of water which is less easily corrupted than a little.
The individual is liable to be overcome by anger or by some other passion, and then his judgment is necessarily perverted; but it is hardly to
be supposed that a great number of persons would all get into a passion
and go wrong at the same moment. Let us assume that they are the
freemen, and that they never act in violation of the law, but fill up the
gaps which the law is obliged to leave. Or, if such virtue is scarcely
attainable by the multitude, we need only suppose that the majority are
76/Aristotle
good men and good citizens, and ask which will be the more incorruptible, the one good ruler, or the many who are all good? Will not the
many? But, you will say, there may be parties among them, whereas the
one man is not divided against himself. To which we may answer that
their character is as good as his. If we call the rule of many men, who
are all of them good, aristocracy, and the rule of one man royalty, then
aristocracy will be better for states than royalty, whether the government is supported by force or not, provided only that a number of men
equal in virtue can be found.
The first governments were kingships, probably for this reason,
because of old, when cities were small, men of eminent virtue were few.
Further, they were made kings because they were benefactors, and benefits can only be bestowed by good men. But when many persons equal
in merit arose, no longer enduring the pre-eminence of one, they desired
to have a commonwealth, and set up a constitution. The ruling class
soon deteriorated and enriched themselves out of the public treasury;
riches became the path to honor, and so oligarchies naturally grew up.
These passed into tyrannies and tyrannies into democracies; for love of
gain in the ruling classes was always tending to diminish their number,
and so to strengthen the masses, who in the end set upon their masters
and established democracies. Since cities have increased in size, no other
form of government appears to be any longer even easy to establish.
Even supposing the principle to be maintained that kingly power is
the best thing for states, how about the family of the king? Are his
children to succeed him? If they are no better than anybody else, that
will be mischievous. But, says the lover of royalty, the king, though he
might, will not hand on his power to his children. That, however, is
hardly to be expected, and is too much to ask of human nature. There is
also a difficulty about the force which he is to employ; should a king
have guards about him by whose aid he may be able to coerce the refractory? If not, how will he administer his kingdom? Even if he be the
lawful sovereign who does nothing arbitrarily or contrary to law, still he
must have some force wherewith to maintain the law. In the case of a
limited monarchy there is not much difficulty in answering this question; the king must have such force as will be more than a match for one
or more individuals, but not so great as that of the people. The ancients
observe this principle when they have guards to any one whom they
appointed dictator or tyrant. Thus, when Dionysius asked the Syracusans
to allow him guards, somebody advised that they should give him only
Politics/77
such a number.
Part XVI
At this place in the discussion there impends the inquiry respecting the
king who acts solely according to his own will he has now to be considered. The so-called limited monarchy, or kingship according to law, as I
have already remarked, is not a distinct form of government, for under
all governments, as, for example, in a democracy or aristocracy, there
may be a general holding office for life, and one person is often made
supreme over the administration of a state. A magistracy of this kind
exists at Epidamnus, and also at Opus, but in the latter city has a more
limited power. Now, absolute monarchy, or the arbitrary rule of a sovereign over an the citizens, in a city which consists of equals, is thought by
some to be quite contrary to nature; it is argued that those who are by
nature equals must have the same natural right and worth, and that for
unequals to have an equal share, or for equals to have an uneven share,
in the offices of state, is as bad as for different bodily constitutions to
have the same food and clothing. Wherefore it is thought to be just that
among equals every one be ruled as well as rule, and therefore that an
should have their turn. We thus arrive at law; for an order of succession
implies law. And the rule of the law, it is argued, is preferable to that of
any individual. On the same principle, even if it be better for certain
individuals to govern, they should be made only guardians and ministers of the law. For magistrates there must be—this is admitted; but then
men say that to give authority to any one man when all are equal is
unjust. Nay, there may indeed be cases which the law seems unable to
determine, but in such cases can a man? Nay, it will be replied, the law
trains officers for this express purpose, and appoints them to determine
matters which are left undecided by it, to the best of their judgment.
Further, it permits them to make any amendment of the existing laws
which experience suggests. Therefore he who bids the law rule may be
deemed to bid God and Reason alone rule, but he who bids man rule
adds an element of the beast; for desire is a wild beast, and passion
perverts the minds of rulers, even when they are the best of men. The
law is reason unaffected by desire. We are told that a patient should call
in a physician; he will not get better if he is doctored out of a book. But
the parallel of the arts is clearly not in point; for the physician does
nothing contrary to rule from motives of friendship; he only cures a
patient and takes a fee; whereas magistrates do many things from spite
78/Aristotle
and partiality. And, indeed, if a man suspected the physician of being in
league with his enemies to destroy him for a bribe, he would rather have
recourse to the book. But certainly physicians, when they are sick, call
in other physicians, and training-masters, when they are in training,
other training-masters, as if they could not judge judge truly about their
own case and might be influenced by their feelings. Hence it is evident
that in seeking for justice men seek for the mean or neutral, for the law
is the mean. Again, customary laws have more weight, and relate to
more important matters, than written laws, and a man may be a safer
ruler than the written law, but not safer than the customary law.
Again, it is by no means easy for one man to superintend many
things; he will have to appoint a number of subordinates, and what
difference does it make whether these subordinates always existed or
were appointed by him because he needed theme If, as I said before, the
good man has a right to rule because he is better, still two good men are
better than one: this is the old saying, two going together, and the prayer
of Agamemnon,
“Would that I had ten such councillors!”
And at this day there are magistrates, for example judges, who have
authority to decide some matters which the law is unable to determine,
since no one doubts that the law would command and decide in the best
manner whatever it could. But some things can, and other things cannot,
be comprehended under the law, and this is the origin of the nexted
question whether the best law or the best man should rule. For matters
of detail about which men deliberate cannot be included in legislation.
Nor does any one deny that the decision of such matters must be left to
man, but it is argued that there should be many judges, and not one only.
For every ruler who has been trained by the law judges well; and it
would surely seem strange that a person should see better with two eyes,
or hear better with two ears, or act better with two hands or feet, than
many with many; indeed, it is already the practice of kings to make to
themselves many eyes and ears and hands and feet. For they make colleagues of those who are the friends of themselves and their governments. They must be friends of the monarch and of his government; if
not his friends, they will not do what he wants; but friendship implies
likeness and equality; and, therefore, if he thinks that his friends ought
to rule, he must think that those who are equal to himself and like him-
Politics/79
self ought to rule equally with himself. These are the principal controversies relating to monarchy.
Part XVII
But may not all this be true in some cases and not in others? for there is
by nature both a justice and an advantage appropriate to the rule of a
master, another to kingly rule, another to constitutional rule; but there is
none naturally appropriate to tyranny, or to any other perverted form of
government; for these come into being contrary to nature. Now, to judge
at least from what has been said, it is manifest that, where men are alike
and equal, it is neither expedient nor just that one man should be lord of
all, whether there are laws, or whether there are no laws, but he himself
is in the place of law. Neither should a good man be lord over good men,
nor a bad man over bad; nor, even if he excels in virtue, should he have
a right to rule, unless in a particular case, at which I have already hinted,
and to which I will once more recur. But first of all, I must determine
what natures are suited for government by a king, and what for an aristocracy, and what for a constitutional government.
A people who are by nature capable of producing a race superior in
the virtue needed for political rule are fitted for kingly government; and
a people submitting to be ruled as freemen by men whose virtue renders
them capable of political command are adapted for an aristocracy; while
the people who are suited for constitutional freedom are those among
whom there naturally exists a warlike multitude able to rule and to obey
in turn by a law which gives office to the well-to-do according to their
desert. But when a whole family or some individual, happens to be so
pre-eminent in virtue as to surpass all others, then it is just that they
should be the royal family and supreme over all, or that this one citizen
should be king of the whole nation. For, as I said before, to give them
authority is not only agreeable to that ground of right which the founders
of all states, whether aristocratical, or oligarchical, or again democratical, are accustomed to put forward (for these all recognize the claim of
excellence, although not the same excellence), but accords with the principle already laid down. For surely it would not be right to kill, or ostracize, or exile such a person, or require that he should take his turn in
being governed. The whole is naturally superior to the part, and he who
has this pre-eminence is in the relation of a whole to a part. But if so, the
only alternative is that he should have the supreme power, and that mankind should obey him, not in turn, but always. These are the conclusions
80/Aristotle
at which we arrive respecting royalty and its various forms, and this is
the answer to the question, whether it is or is not advantageous to states,
and to which, and how.
Part XVIII
We maintain that the true forms of government are three, and that the
best must be that which is administered by the best, and in which there
is one man, or a whole family, or many persons, excelling all the others
together in virtue, and both rulers and subjects are fitted, the one to rule,
the others to be ruled, in such a manner as to attain the most eligible life.
We showed at the commencement of our inquiry that the virtue of the
good man is necessarily the same as the virtue of the citizen of the perfect state. Clearly then in the same manner, and by the same means
through which a man becomes truly good, he will frame a state that is to
be ruled by an aristocracy or by a king, and the same education and the
same habits will be found to make a good man and a man fit to be a
statesman or a king.
Having arrived at these conclusions, we must proceed to speak of
the perfect state, and describe how it comes into being and is established.
BOOK FOUR
Part I
In all arts and sciences which embrace the whole of any subject, and do
not come into being in a fragmentary way, it is the province of a single
art or science to consider all that appertains to a single subject. For
example, the art of gymnastic considers not only the suitableness of
different modes of training to different bodies (2), but what sort is absolutely the best (1); (for the absolutely best must suit that which is by
nature best and best furnished with the means of life), and also what
common form of training is adapted to the great majority of men (4).
And if a man does not desire the best habit of body, or the greatest skill
in gymnastics, which might be attained by him, still the trainer or the
teacher of gymnastic should be able to impart any lower degree of either
(3). The same principle equally holds in medicine and shipbuilding, and
the making of clothes, and in the arts generally.
Hence it is obvious that government too is the subject of a single
science, which has to consider what government is best and of what sort
Politics/81
it must be, to be most in accordance with our aspirations, if there were
no external impediment, and also what kind of government is adapted to
particular states. For the best is often unattainable, and therefore the
true legislator and statesman ought to be acquainted, not only with (1)
that which is best in the abstract, but also with (2) that which is best
relatively to circumstances. We should be able further to say how a state
may be constituted under any given conditions (3); both how it is originally formed and, when formed, how it may be longest preserved; the
supposed state being so far from having the best constitution that it is
unprovided even with the conditions necessary for the best; neither is it
the best under the circumstances, but of an inferior type.
He ought, moreover, to know (4) the form of government which is
best suited to states in general; for political writers, although they have
excellent ideas, are often unpractical. We should consider, not only what
form of government is best, but also what is possible and what is easily
attainable by all. There are some who would have none but the most
perfect; for this many natural advantages are required. Others, again,
speak of a more attainable form, and, although they reject the constitution under which they are living, they extol some one in particular, for
example the Lacedaemonian. Any change of government which has to
be introduced should be one which men, starting from their existing
constitutions, will be both willing and able to adopt, since there is quite
as much trouble in the reformation of an old constitution as in the establishment of a new one, just as to unlearn is as hard as to learn. And
therefore, in addition to the qualifications of the statesman already mentioned, he should be able to find remedies for the defects of existing
constitutions, as has been said before. This he cannot do unless he knows
how many forms of government there are. It is often supposed that there
is only one kind of democracy and one of oligarchy. But this is a mistake; and, in order to avoid such mistakes, we must ascertain what differences there are in the constitutions of states, and in how many ways
they are combined. The same political insight will enable a man to know
which laws are the best, and which are suited to different constitutions;
for the laws are, and ought to be, relative to the constitution, and not the
constitution to the laws. A constitution is the organization of offices in a
state, and determines what is to be the governing body, and what is the
end of each community. But laws are not to be confounded with the
principles of the constitution; they are the rules according to which the
magistrates should administer the state, and proceed against offenders.
82/Aristotle
So that we must know the varieties, and the number of varieties, of each
form of government, if only with a view to making laws. For the same
laws cannot be equally suited to all oligarchies or to all democracies,
since there is certainly more than one form both of democracy and of
oligarchy.
Part II
In our original discussion about governments we divided them into three
true forms: kingly rule, aristocracy, and constitutional government, and
three corresponding perversions—tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy.
Of kingly rule and of aristocracy, we have already spoken, for the inquiry into the perfect state is the same thing with the discussion of the
two forms thus named, since both imply a principle of virtue provided
with external means. We have already determined in what aristocracy
and kingly rule differ from one another, and when the latter should be
established. In what follows we have to describe the so-called constitutional government, which bears the common name of all constitutions,
and the other forms, tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy.
It is obvious which of the three perversions is the worst, and which
is the next in badness. That which is the perversion of the first and most
divine is necessarily the worst. And just as a royal rule, if not a mere
name, must exist by virtue of some great personal superiority in the
king, so tyranny, which is the worst of governments, is necessarily the
farthest removed from a well-constituted form; oligarchy is little better,
for it is a long way from aristocracy, and democracy is the most tolerable of the three.
A writer who preceded me has already made these distinctions, but
his point of view is not the same as mine. For he lays down the principle
that when all the constitutions are good (the oligarchy and the rest being
virtuous), democracy is the worst, but the best when all are bad. Whereas
we maintain that they are in any case defective, and that one oligarchy is
not to be accounted better than another, but only less bad.
Not to pursue this question further at present, let us begin by determining (1) how many varieties of constitution there are (since of democracy and oligarchy there are several): (2) what constitution is the most
generally acceptable, and what is eligible in the next degree after the
perfect state; and besides this what other there is which is aristocratical
and well-constituted, and at the same time adapted to states in general;
(3) of the other forms of government to whom each is suited. For de-
Politics/83
mocracy may meet the needs of some better than oligarchy, and conversely. In the next place (4) we have to consider in what manner a man
ought to proceed who desires to establish some one among these various
forms, whether of democracy or of oligarchy; and lastly, (5) having
briefly discussed these subjects to the best of our power, we will endeavor to ascertain the modes of ruin and preservation both of constitutions generally and of each separately, and to what causes they are to be
attributed.
Part III
The reason why there are many forms of government is that every state
contains many elements. In the first place we see that all states are made
up of families, and in the multitude of citizen there must be some rich
and some poor, and some in a middle condition; the rich are heavyarmed, and the poor not. Of the common people, some are husbandmen,
and some traders, and some artisans. There are also among the notables
differences of wealth and property—for example, in the number of horses
which they keep, for they cannot afford to keep them unless they are
rich. And therefore in old times the cities whose strength lay in their
cavalry were oligarchies, and they used cavalry in wars against their
neighbors; as was the practice of the Eretrians and Chalcidians, and
also of the Magnesians on the river Maeander, and of other peoples in
Asia. Besides differences of wealth there are differences of rank and
merit, and there are some other elements which were mentioned by us
when in treating of aristocracy we enumerated the essentials of a state.
Of these elements, sometimes all, sometimes the lesser and sometimes
the greater number, have a share in the government. It is evident then
that there must be many forms of government, differing in kind, since
the parts of which they are composed differ from each other in kind. For
a constitution is an organization of offices, which all the citizens distribute among themselves, according to the power which different classes
possess, for example the rich or the poor, or according to some principle
of equality which includes both. There must therefore be as many forms
of government as there are modes of arranging the offices, according to
the superiorities and differences of the parts of the state.
There are generally thought to be two principal forms: as men say
of the winds that there are but two—north and south, and that the rest of
them are only variations of these, so of governments there are said to be
only two forms—democracy and oligarchy. For aristocracy is consid-
84/Aristotle
ered to be a kind of oligarchy, as being the rule of a few, and the socalled constitutional government to be really a democracy, just as among
the winds we make the west a variation of the north, and the east of the
south wind. Similarly of musical modes there are said to be two kinds,
the Dorian and the Phrygian; the other arrangements of the scale are
comprehended under one or other of these two. About forms of government this is a very favorite notion. But in either case the better and more
exact way is to distinguish, as I have done, the one or two which are true
forms, and to regard the others as perversions, whether of the most
perfectly attempered mode or of the best form of government: we may
compare the severer and more overpowering modes to the oligarchical
forms, and the more relaxed and gentler ones to the democratic.
Part IV
It must not be assumed, as some are fond of saying, that democracy is
simply that form of government in which the greater number are sovereign, for in oligarchies, and indeed in every government, the majority
rules; nor again is oligarchy that form of government in which a few are
sovereign. Suppose the whole population of a city to be 1300, and that
of these 1000 are rich, and do not allow the remaining 300 who are
poor, but free, and in an other respects their equals, a share of the government—no one will say that this is a democracy. In like manner, if the
poor were few and the masters of the rich who outnumber them, no one
would ever call such a government, in which the rich majority have no
share of office, an oligarchy. Therefore we should rather say that democracy is the form of government in which the free are rulers, and
oligarchy in which the rich; it is only an accident that the free are the
many and the rich are the few. Otherwise a government in which the
offices were given according to stature, as is said to be the case in Ethiopia, or according to beauty, would be an oligarchy; for the number of
tall or good-looking men is small. And yet oligarchy and democracy are
not sufficiently distinguished merely by these two characteristics of wealth
and freedom. Both of them contain many other elements, and therefore
we must carry our analysis further, and say that the government is not a
democracy in which the freemen, being few in number, rule over the
many who are not free, as at Apollonia, on the Ionian Gulf, and at
Thera; (for in each of these states the nobles, who were also the earliest
settlers, were held in chief honor, although they were but a few out of
many). Neither is it a democracy when the rich have the government
Politics/85
because they exceed in number; as was the case formerly at Colophon,
where the bulk of the inhabitants were possessed of large property before the Lydian War. But the form of government is a democracy when
the free, who are also poor and the majority, govern, and an oligarchy
when the rich and the noble govern, they being at the same time few in
number.
I have said that there are many forms of government, and have explained to what causes the variety is due. Why there are more than those
already mentioned, and what they are, and whence they arise, I will now
proceed to consider, starting from the principle already admitted, which
is that every state consists, not of one, but of many parts. If we were
going to speak of the different species of animals, we should first of all
determine the organs which are indispensable to every animal, as for
example some organs of sense and the instruments of receiving and digesting food, such as the mouth and the stomach, besides organs of
locomotion. Assuming now that there are only so many kinds of organs,
but that there may be differences in them—I mean different kinds of
mouths, and stomachs, and perceptive and locomotive organs—the possible combinations of these differences will necessarily furnish many
variedes of animals. (For animals cannot be the same which have different kinds of mouths or of ears.) And when all the combinations are
exhausted, there will be as many sorts of animals as there are combinations of the necessary organs. The same, then, is true of the forms of
government which have been described; states, as I have repeatedly said,
are composed, not of one, but of many elements. One element is the
food-producing class, who are called husbandmen; a second, the class
of mechanics who practice the arts without which a city cannot exist; of
these arts some are absolutely necessary, others contribute to luxury or
to the grace of life. The third class is that of traders, and by traders I
mean those who are engaged in buying and selling, whether in commerce or in retail trade. A fourth class is that of the serfs or laborers.
The warriors make up the fifth class, and they are as necessary as any
of the others, if the country is not to be the slave of every invader. For
how can a state which has any title to the name be of a slavish nature?
The state is independent and self-sufficing, but a slave is the reverse of
independent. Hence we see that this subject, though ingeniously, has not
been satisfactorily treated in the Republic. Socrates says that a state is
made up of four sorts of people who are absolutely necessary; these are
a weaver, a husbandman, a shoemaker, and a builder; afterwards, find-
86/Aristotle
ing that they are not enough, he adds a smith, and again a herdsman, to
look after the necessary animals; then a merchant, and then a retail
trader. All these together form the complement of the first state, as if a
state were established merely to supply the necessaries of life, rather
than for the sake of the good, or stood equally in need of shoemakers
and of husbandmen. But he does not admit into the state a military class
until the country has increased in size, and is beginning to encroach on
its neighbor’s land, whereupon they go to war. Yet even amongst his
four original citizens, or whatever be the number of those whom he
associates in the state, there must be some one who will dispense justice
and determine what is just. And as the soul may be said to be more truly
part of an animal than the body, so the higher parts of states, that is to
say, the warrior class, the class engaged in the administration of justice,
and that engaged in deliberation, which is the special business of political common sense-these are more essential to the state than the parts
which minister to the necessaries of life. Whether their several functions
are the functions of different citizens, or of the same—for it may often
happen that the same persons are both warriors and husbandmen—is
immaterial to the argument. The higher as well as the lower elements
are to be equally considered parts of the state, and if so, the military
element at any rate must be included. There are also the wealthy who
minister to the state with their property; these form the seventh class.
The eighth class is that of magistrates and of officers; for the state cannot exist without rulers. And therefore some must be able to take office
and to serve the state, either always or in turn. There only remains the
class of those who deliberate and who judge between disputants; we
were just now distinguishing them. If presence of all these elements, and
their fair and equitable organization, is necessary to states, then there
must also be persons who have the ability of statesmen. Different functions appear to be often combined in the same individual; for example,
the warrior may also be a husbandman, or an artisan; or, again, the
councillor a judge. And all claim to possess political ability, and think
that they are quite competent to fill most offices. But the same persons
cannot be rich and poor at the same time. For this reason the rich and
the poor are regarded in an especial sense as parts of a state. Again,
because the rich are generally few in number, while the poor are many,
they appear to be antagonistic, and as the one or the other prevails they
form the government. Hence arises the common opinion that there are
two kinds of government—democracy and oligarchy.
Politics/87
I have already explained that there are many forms of constitution,
and to what causes the variety is due. Let me now show that there are
different forms both of democracy and oligarchy, as will indeed be evident from what has preceded. For both in the common people and in the
notables various classes are included; of the common people, one class
are husbandmen, another artisans; another traders, who are employed
in buying and selling; another are the seafaring class, whether engaged
in war or in trade, as ferrymen or as fishermen. (In many places any one
of these classes forms quite a large population; for example, fishermen
at Tarentum and Byzantium, crews of triremes at Athens, merchant seamen at Aegina and Chios, ferrymen at Tenedos.) To the classes already
mentioned may be added day-laborers, and those who, owing to their
needy circumstances, have no leisure, or those who are not of free birth
on both sides; and there may be other classes as well. The notables
again may be divided according to their wealth, birth, virtue, education,
and similar differences.
Of forms of democracy first comes that which is said to be based
strictly on equality. In such a democracy the law says that it is just for
the poor to have no more advantage than the rich; and that neither should
be masters, but both equal. For if liberty and equality, as is thought by
some, are chiefly to be found in democracy, they will be best attained
when all persons alike share in the government to the utmost. And since
the people are the majority, and the opinion of the majority is decisive,
such a government must necessarily be a democracy. Here then is one
sort of democracy. There is another, in which the magistrates are elected
according to a certain property qualification, but a low one; he who has
the required amount of property has a share in the government, but he
who loses his property loses his rights. Another kind is that in which all
the citizens who are under no disqualification share in the government,
but still the law is supreme. In another, everybody, if he be only a citizen, is admitted to the government, but the law is supreme as before. A
fifth form of democracy, in other respects the same, is that in which, not
the law, but the multitude, have the supreme power, and supersede the
law by their decrees. This is a state of affairs brought about by the
demagogues. For in democracies which are subject to the law the best
citizens hold the first place, and there are no demagogues; but where the
laws are not supreme, there demagogues spring up. For the people becomes a monarch, and is many in one; and the many have the power in
their hands, not as individuals, but collectively. Homer says that ‘it is
88/Aristotle
not good to have a rule of many,’ but whether he means this corporate
rule, or the rule of many individuals, is uncertain. At all events this sort
of democracy, which is now a monarch, and no longer under the control
of law, seeks to exercise monarchical sway, and grows into a despot; the
flatterer is held in honor; this sort of democracy being relatively to other
democracies what tyranny is to other forms of monarchy. The spirit of
both is the same, and they alike exercise a despotic rule over the better
citizens. The decrees of the demos correspond to the edicts of the tyrant;
and the demagogue is to the one what the flatterer is to the other. Both
have great power; the flatterer with the tyrant, the demagogue with democracies of the kind which we are describing. The demagogues make
the decrees of the people override the laws, by referring all things to the
popular assembly. And therefore they grow great, because the people
have an things in their hands, and they hold in their hands the votes of
the people, who are too ready to listen to them. Further, those who have
any complaint to bring against the magistrates say, ‘Let the people be
judges’; the people are too happy to accept the invitation; and so the
authority of every office is undermined. Such a democracy is fairly open
to the objection that it is not a constitution at all; for where the laws
have no authority, there is no constitution. The law ought to be supreme
over all, and the magistracies should judge of particulars, and only this
should be considered a constitution. So that if democracy be a real form
of government, the sort of system in which all things are regulated by
decrees is clearly not even a democracy in the true sense of the word, for
decrees relate only to particulars.
These then are the different kinds of democracy.
Part V
Of oligarchies, too, there are different kinds: one where the property
qualification for office is such that the poor, although they form the
majority, have no share in the government, yet he who acquires a qualification may obtain a share. Another sort is when there is a qualification
for office, but a high one, and the vacancies in the governing body are
fired by co-optation. If the election is made out of all the qualified persons, a constitution of this kind inclines to an aristocracy, if out of a
privileged class, to an oligarchy. Another sort of oligarchy is when the
son succeeds the father. There is a fourth form, likewise hereditary, in
which the magistrates are supreme and not the law. Among oligarchies
this is what tyranny is among monarchies, and the last-mentioned form
Politics/89
of democracy among democracies; and in fact this sort of oligarchy
receives the name of a dynasty (or rule of powerful families).
These are the different sorts of oligarchies and democracies. It should,
however, be remembered that in many states the constitution which is
established by law, although not democratic, owing to the education and
habits of the people may be administered democratically, and conversely
in other states the established constitution may incline to democracy,
but may be administered in an oligarchical spirit. This most often happens after a revolution: for governments do not change at once; at first
the dominant party are content with encroaching a little upon their opponents. The laws which existed previously continue in force, but the
authors of the revolution have the power in their hands.
Part VI
From what has been already said we may safely infer that there are so
many different kinds of democracies and of oligarchies. For it is evident
that either all the classes whom we mentioned must share in the government, or some only and not others. When the class of husbandmen and
of those who possess moderate fortunes have the supreme power, the
government is administered according to law. For the citizens being compelled to live by their labor have no leisure; and so they set up the authority of the law, and attend assemblies only when necessary. They all
obtain a share in the government when they have acquired the qualification which is fixed by the law—the absolute exclusion of any class
would be a step towards oligarchy; hence all who have acquired the
property qualification are admitted to a share in the constitution. But
leisure cannot be provided for them unless there are revenues to support
them. This is one sort of democracy, and these are the causes which give
birth to it. Another kind is based on the distinction which naturally comes
next in order; in this, every one to whose birth there is no objection is
eligible, but actually shares in the government only if he can find leisure. Hence in such a democracy the supreme power is vested in the
laws, because the state has no means of paying the citizens. A third kind
is when all freemen have a right to share in the government, but do not
actually share, for the reason which has been already given; so that in
this form again the law must rule. A fourth kind of democracy is that
which comes latest in the history of states. In our own day, when cities
have far outgrown their original size, and their revenues have increased,
all the citizens have a place in the government, through the great pre-
90/Aristotle
ponderance of the multitude; and they all, including the poor who receive pay, and therefore have leisure to exercise their rights, share in the
administration. Indeed, when they are paid, the common people have the
most leisure, for they are not hindered by the care of their property,
which often fetters the rich, who are thereby prevented from taking part
in the assembly or in the courts, and so the state is governed by the poor,
who are a majority, and not by the laws.
So many kinds of democracies there are, and they grow out of these
necessary causes.
Of oligarchies, one form is that in which the majority of the citizens
have some property, but not very much; and this is the first form, which
allows to any one who obtains the required amount the right of sharing
in the government. The sharers in the government being a numerous
body, it follows that the law must govern, and not individuals. For in
proportion as they are further removed from a monarchical form of
government, and in respect of property have neither so much as to be
able to live without attending to business, nor so little as to need state
support, they must admit the rule of law and not claim to rule themselves. But if the men of property in the state are fewer than in the
former case, and own more property, there arises a second form of oligarchy. For the stronger they are, the more power they claim, and having this object in view, they themselves select those of the other classes
who are to be admitted to the government; but, not being as yet strong
enough to rule without the law, they make the law represent their wishes.
When this power is intensified by a further diminution of their numbers
and increase of their property, there arises a third and further stage of
oligarchy, in which the governing class keep the offices in their own
hands, and the law ordains that the son shall succeed the father. When,
again, the rulers have great wealth and numerous friends, this sort of
family despotism approaches a monarchy; individuals rule and not the
law. This is the fourth sort of oligarchy, and is analogous to the last sort
of democracy.
Part VII
There are still two forms besides democracy and oligarchy; one of them
is universally recognized and included among the four principal forms
of government, which are said to be (1) monarchy, (2) oligarchy, (3)
democracy, and (4) the so-called aristocracy or government of the best.
But there is also a fifth, which retains the generic name of polity or
Politics/91
constitutional government; this is not common, and therefore has not
been noticed by writers who attempt to enumerate the different kinds of
government; like Plato, in their books about the state, they recognize
four only. The term ‘aristocracy’ is rightly applied to the form of government which is described in the first part of our treatise; for that only
can be rightly called aristocracy which is a government formed of the
best men absolutely, and not merely of men who are good when tried by
any given standard. In the perfect state the good man is absolutely the
same as the good citizen; whereas in other states the good citizen is only
good relatively to his own form of government. But there are some states
differing from oligarchies and also differing from the so-called polity or
constitutional government; these are termed aristocracies, and in them
the magistrates are certainly chosen, both according to their wealth and
according to their merit. Such a form of government differs from each
of the two just now mentioned, and is termed an aristocracy. For indeed
in states which do not make virtue the aim of the community, men of
merit and reputation for virtue may be found. And so where a government has regard to wealth, virtue, and numbers, as at Carthage, that is
aristocracy; and also where it has regard only to two out of the three, as
at Lacedaemon, to virtue and numbers, and the two principles of democracy and virtue temper each other. There are these two forms of
aristocracy in addition to the first and perfect state, and there is a third
form, viz., the constitutions which incline more than the so-called polity
towards oligarchy.
Part VIII
I have yet to speak of the so-called polity and of tyranny. I put them in
this order, not because a polity or constitutional government is to be
regarded as a perversion any more than the above mentioned aristocracies. The truth is, that they an fall short of the most perfect form of
government, and so they are reckoned among perversions, and the really
perverted forms are perversions of these, as I said in the original discussion. Last of all I will speak of tyranny, which I place last in the series
because I am inquiring into the constitutions of states, and this is the
very reverse of a constitution
Having explained why I have adopted this order, I will proceed to
consider constitutional government; of which the nature will be clearer
now that oligarchy and democracy have been defined. For polity or constitutional government may be described generally as a fusion of oligar-
92/Aristotle
chy and democracy; but the term is usually applied to those forms of
government which incline towards democracy, and the term aristocracy
to those which incline towards oligarchy, because birth and education
are commonly the accompaniments of wealth. Moreover, the rich already possess the external advantages the want of which is a temptation
to crime, and hence they are called noblemen and gentlemen. And inasmuch as aristocracy seeks to give predominance to the best of the citizens, people say also of oligarchies that they are composed of noblemen
and gentlemen. Now it appears to be an impossible thing that the state
which is governed not by the best citizens but by the worst should be
well-governed, and equally impossible that the state which is ill-governed should be governed by the best. But we must remember that good
laws, if they are not obeyed, do not constitute good government. Hence
there are two parts of good government; one is the actual obedience of
citizens to the laws, the other part is the goodness of the laws which they
obey; they may obey bad laws as well as good. And there may be a
further subdivision; they may obey either the best laws which are attainable to them, or the best absolutely.
The distribution of offices according to merit is a special characteristic of aristocracy, for the principle of an aristocracy is virtue, as wealth
is of an oligarchy, and freedom of a democracy. In all of them there of
course exists the right of the majority, and whatever seems good to the
majority of those who share in the government has authority. Now in
most states the form called polity exists, for the fusion goes no further
than the attempt to unite the freedom of the poor and the wealth of the
rich, who commonly take the place of the noble. But as there are three
grounds on which men claim an equal share in the government, freedom, wealth, and virtue (for the fourth or good birth is the result of the
two last, being only ancient wealth and virtue), it is clear that the admixture of the two elements, that is to say, of the rich and poor, is to be
called a polity or constitutional government; and the union of the three
is to be called aristocracy or the government of the best, and more than
any other form of government, except the true and ideal, has a right to
this name.
Thus far I have shown the existence of forms of states other than
monarchy, democracy, and oligarchy, and what they are, and in what
aristocracies differ from one another, and polities from aristocracies—
that the two latter are not very unlike is obvious.
Politics/93
Part IX
Next we have to consider how by the side of oligarchy and democracy
the so-called polity or constitutional government springs up, and how it
should be organized. The nature of it will be at once understood from a
comparison of oligarchy and democracy; we must ascertain their different characteristics, and taking a portion from each, put the two together,
like the parts of an indenture. Now there are three modes in which fusions of government may be affected. In the first mode we must combine
the laws made by both governments, say concerning the administration
of justice. In oligarchies they impose a fine on the rich if they do not
serve as judges, and to the poor they give no pay; but in democracies
they give pay to the poor and do not fine the rich. Now (1) the union of
these two modes is a common or middle term between them, and is
therefore characteristic of a constitutional government, for it is a combination of both. This is one mode of uniting the two elements. Or (2) a
mean may be taken between the enactments of the two: thus democracies require no property qualification, or only a small one, from members of the assembly, oligarchies a high one; here neither of these is the
common term, but a mean between them. (3) There is a third mode, in
which something is borrowed from the oligarchical and something from
the democratical principle. For example, the appointment of magistrates
by lot is thought to be democratical, and the election of them oligarchical; democratical again when there is no property qualification, oligarchical when there is. In the aristocratical or constitutional state, one
element will be taken from each—from oligarchy the principle of electing to offices, from democracy the disregard of qualification. Such are
the various modes of combination.
There is a true union of oligarchy and democracy when the same
state may be termed either a democracy or an oligarchy; those who use
both names evidently feel that the fusion is complete. Such a fusion
there is also in the mean; for both extremes appear in it. The
Lacedaemonian constitution, for example, is often described as a democracy, because it has many democratical features. In the first place
the youth receive a democratical education. For the sons of the poor are
brought up with with the sons of the rich, who are educated in such a
manner as to make it possible for the sons of the poor to be educated by
them. A similar equality prevails in the following period of life, and
when the citizens are grown up to manhood the same rule is observed;
there is no distinction between the rich and poor. In like manner they all
94/Aristotle
have the same food at their public tables, and the rich wear only such
clothing as any poor man can afford. Again, the people elect to one of
the two greatest offices of state, and in the other they share; for they
elect the Senators and share in the Ephoralty. By others the Spartan
constitution is said to be an oligarchy, because it has many oligarchical
elements. That all offices are filled by election and none by lot, is one of
these oligarchical characteristics; that the power of inflicting death or
banishment rests with a few persons is another; and there are others. In
a well attempted polity there should appear to be both elements and yet
neither; also the government should rely on itself, and not on foreign
aid, and on itself not through the good will of a majority—they might be
equally well-disposed when there is a vicious form of government—but
through the general willingness of all classes in the state to maintain the
constitution.
Enough of the manner in which a constitutional government, and in
which the so-called aristocracies ought to be framed.
Part X
Of the nature of tyranny I have still to speak, in order that it may have
its place in our inquiry (since even tyranny is reckoned by us to be a
form of government), although there is not much to be said about it. I
have already in the former part of this treatise discussed royalty or kingship according to the most usual meaning of the term, and considered
whether it is or is not advantageous to states, and what kind of royalty
should be established, and from what source, and how.
When speaking of royalty we also spoke of two forms of tyranny,
which are both according to law, and therefore easily pass into royalty.
Among barbarians there are elected monarchs who exercise a despotic
power; despotic rulers were also elected in ancient Hellas, called
Aesymnetes or Dictators. These monarchies, when compared with one
another, exhibit certain differences. And they are, as I said before, royal,
in so far as the monarch rules according to law over willing subjects;
but they are tyrannical in so far as he is despotic and rules according to
his own fancy. There is also a third kind of tyranny, which is the most
typical form, and is the counterpart of the perfect monarchy. This tyranny is just that arbitrary power of an individual which is responsible to
no one, and governs all alike, whether equals or better, with a view to its
own advantage, not to that of its subjects, and therefore against their
will. No freeman, if he can escape from it, will endure such a govern-
Politics/95
ment.
The kinds of tyranny are such and so many, and for the reasons
which I have given.
Part XI
We have now to inquire what is the best constitution for most states, and
the best life for most men, neither assuming a standard of virtue which
is above ordinary persons, nor an education which is exceptionally favored by nature and circumstances, nor yet an ideal state which is an
aspiration only, but having regard to the life in which the majority are
able to share, and to the form of government which states in general can
attain. As to those aristocracies, as they are called, of which we were
just now speaking, they either lie beyond the possibilities of the greater
number of states, or they approximate to the so-called constitutional
government, and therefore need no separate discussion. And in fact the
conclusion at which we arrive respecting all these forms rests upon the
same grounds. For if what was said in the Ethics is true, that the happy
life is the life according to virtue lived without impediment, and that
virtue is a mean, then the life which is in a mean, and in a mean attainable by every one, must be the best. And the same the same principles of
virtue and vice are characteristic of cities and of constitutions; for the
constitution is in a figure the life of the city.
Now in all states there are three elements: one class is very rich,
another very poor, and a third in a mean. It is admitted that moderation
and the mean are best, and therefore it will clearly be best to possess the
gifts of fortune in moderation; for in that condition of life men are most
ready to follow rational principle. But he who greatly excels in beauty,
strength, birth, or wealth, or on the other hand who is very poor, or very
weak, or very much disgraced, finds it difficult to follow rational principle. Of these two the one sort grow into violent and great criminals,
the others into rogues and petty rascals. And two sorts of offenses correspond to them, the one committed from violence, the other from roguery. Again, the middle class is least likely to shrink from rule, or to be
over-ambitious for it; both of which are injuries to the state. Again,
those who have too much of the goods of fortune, strength, wealth, friends,
and the like, are neither willing nor able to submit to authority. The evil
begins at home; for when they are boys, by reason of the luxury in
which they are brought up, they never learn, even at school, the habit of
obedience. On the other hand, the very poor, who are in the opposite
96/Aristotle
extreme, are too degraded. So that the one class cannot obey, and can
only rule despotically; the other knows not how to command and must
be ruled like slaves. Thus arises a city, not of freemen, but of masters
and slaves, the one despising, the other envying; and nothing can be
more fatal to friendship and good fellowship in states than this: for good
fellowship springs from friendship; when men are at enmity with one
another, they would rather not even share the same path. But a city
ought to be composed, as far as possible, of equals and similars; and
these are generally the middle classes. Wherefore the city which is composed of middle-class citizens is necessarily best constituted in respect
of the elements of which we say the fabric of the state naturally consists.
And this is the class of citizens which is most secure in a state, for they
do not, like the poor, covet their neighbors’ goods; nor do others covet
theirs, as the poor covet the goods of the rich; and as they neither plot
against others, nor are themselves plotted against, they pass through life
safely. Wisely then did Phocylides pray—‘Many things are best in the
mean; I desire to be of a middle condition in my city.’
Thus it is manifest that the best political community is formed by
citizens of the middle class, and that those states are likely to be welladministered in which the middle class is large, and stronger if possible
than both the other classes, or at any rate than either singly; for the
addition of the middle class turns the scale, and prevents either of the
extremes from being dominant. Great then is the good fortune of a state
in which the citizens have a moderate and sufficient property; for where
some possess much, and the others nothing, there may arise an extreme
democracy, or a pure oligarchy; or a tyranny may grow out of either
extreme—either out of the most rampant democracy, or out of an oligarchy; but it is not so likely to arise out of the middle constitutions and
those akin to them. I will explain the reason of this hereafter, when I
speak of the revolutions of states. The mean condition of states is clearly
best, for no other is free from faction; and where the middle class is
large, there are least likely to be factions and dissensions. For a similar
reason large states are less liable to faction than small ones, because in
them the middle class is large; whereas in small states it is easy to divide
all the citizens into two classes who are either rich or poor, and to leave
nothing in the middle. And democracies are safer and more permanent
than oligarchies, because they have a middle class which is more numerous and has a greater share in the government; for when there is no
middle class, and the poor greatly exceed in number, troubles arise, and
Politics/97
the state soon comes to an end. A proof of the superiority of the middle
dass is that the best legislators have been of a middle condition; for
example, Solon, as his own verses testify; and Lycurgus, for he was not
a king; and Charondas, and almost all legislators.
These considerations will help us to understand why most governments are either democratical or oligarchical. The reason is that the
middle class is seldom numerous in them, and whichever party, whether
the rich or the common people, transgresses the mean and predominates, draws the constitution its own way, and thus arises either oligarchy or democracy. There is another reason—the poor and the rich quarrel with one another, and whichever side gets the better, instead of establishing a just or popular government, regards political supremacy as the
prize of victory, and the one party sets up a democracy and the other an
oligarchy. Further, both the parties which had the supremacy in Hellas
looked only to the interest of their own form of government, and established in states, the one, democracies, and the other, oligarchies; they
thought of their own advantage, of the public not at all. For these reasons the middle form of government has rarely, if ever, existed, and
among a very few only. One man alone of all who ever ruled in Hellas
was induced to give this middle constitution to states. But it has now
become a habit among the citizens of states, not even to care about
equality; all men are seeking for dominion, or, if conquered, are willing
to submit.
What then is the best form of government, and what makes it the
best, is evident; and of other constitutions, since we say that there are
many kinds of democracy and many of oligarchy, it is not difficult to see
which has the first and which the second or any other place in the order
of excellence, now that we have determined which is the best. For that
which is nearest to the best must of necessity be better, and that which is
furthest from it worse, if we are judging absolutely and not relatively to
given conditions: I say ‘relatively to given conditions,’ since a particular government may be preferable, but another form may be better for
some people.
Part XII
We have now to consider what and what kind of government is suitable
to what and what kind of men. I may begin by assuming, as a general
principle common to all governments, that the portion of the state which
desires the permanence of the constitution ought to be stronger than that
98/Aristotle
which desires the reverse. Now every city is composed of quality and
quantity. By quality I mean freedom, wealth, education, good birth, and
by quantity, superiority of numbers. Quality may exist in one of the
classes which make up the state, and quantity in the other. For example,
the meanly-born may be more in number than the well-born, or the poor
than the rich, yet they may not so much exceed in quantity as they fall
short in quality; and therefore there must be a comparison of quantity
and quality. Where the number of the poor is more than proportioned to
the wealth of the rich, there will naturally be a democracy, varying in
form with the sort of people who compose it in each case. If, for example, the husbandmen exceed in number, the first form of democracy
will then arise; if the artisans and laboring class, the last; and so with
the intermediate forms. But where the rich and the notables exceed in
quality more than they fall short in quantity, there oligarchy arises, similarly assuming various forms according to the kind of superiority possessed by the oligarchs.
The legislator should always include the middle class in his government; if he makes his laws oligarchical, to the middle class let him look;
if he makes them democratical, he should equally by his laws try to
attach this class to the state. There only can the government ever be
stable where the middle class exceeds one or both of the others, and in
that case there will be no fear that the rich will unite with the poor
against the rulers. For neither of them will ever be willing to serve the
other, and if they look for some form of government more suitable to
both, they will find none better than this, for the rich and the poor will
never consent to rule in turn, because they mistrust one another. The
arbiter is always the one trusted, and he who is in the middle is an
arbiter. The more perfect the admixture of the political elements, the
more lasting will be the constitution. Many even of those who desire to
form aristocratical governments make a mistake, not only in giving too
much power to the rich, but in attempting to overreach the people. There
comes a time when out of a false good there arises a true evil, since the
encroachments of the rich are more destructive to the constitution than
those of the people.
Part XIII
The devices by which oligarchies deceive the people are five in number;
they relate to (1) the assembly; (2) the magistracies; (3) the courts of
law; (4) the use of arms; (5) gymnastic exercises. (1) The assemblies
Politics/99
are thrown open to all, but either the rich only are fined for non-attendance, or a much larger fine is inflicted upon them. (2) to the magistracies, those who are qualified by property cannot decline office upon
oath, but the poor may. (3) In the law courts the rich, and the rich only,
are fined if they do not serve, the poor are let off with impunity, or, as in
the laws of Charondas, a larger fine is inflicted on the rich, and a smaller
one on the poor. In some states all citizen who have registered themselves are allowed to attend the assembly and to try causes; but if after
registration they do not attend either in the assembly or at the courts,
heavy fines are imposed upon them. The intention is that through fear of
the fines they may avoid registering themselves, and then they cannot sit
in the law-courts or in the assembly. concerning (4) the possession of
arms, and (5) gymnastic exercises, they legislate in a similar spirit. For
the poor are not obliged to have arms, but the rich are fined for not
having them; and in like manner no penalty is inflicted on the poor for
non-attendance at the gymnasium, and consequently, having nothing to
fear, they do not attend, whereas the rich are liable to a fine, and therefore they take care to attend.
These are the devices of oligarchical legislators, and in democracies
they have counter devices. They pay the poor for attending the assemblies and the law-courts, and they inflict no penalty on the rich for nonattendance. It is obvious that he who would duly mix the two principles
should combine the practice of both, and provide that the poor should be
paid to attend, and the rich fined if they do not attend, for then all will
take part; if there is no such combination, power will be in the hands of
one party only. The government should be confined to those who carry
arms. As to the property qualification, no absolute rule can be laid down,
but we must see what is the highest qualification sufficiently comprehensive to secure that the number of those who have the rights of citizens exceeds the number of those excluded. Even if they have no share
in office, the poor, provided only that they are not outraged or deprived
of their property, will be quiet enough.
But to secure gentle treatment for the poor is not an easy thing,
since a ruling class is not always humane. And in time of war the poor
are apt to hesitate unless they are fed; when fed, they are willing enough
to fight. In some states the government is vested, not only in those who
are actually serving, but also in those who have served; among the
Malians, for example, the governing body consisted of the latter, while
the magistrates were chosen from those actually on service. And the
100/Aristotle
earliest government which existed among the Hellenes, after the overthrow of the kingly power, grew up out of the warrior class, and was
originally taken from the knights (for strength and superiority in war at
that time depended on cavalry; indeed, without discipline, infantry are
useless, and in ancient times there was no military knowledge or tactics,
and therefore the strength of armies lay in their cavalry). But when
cities increased and the heavy armed grew in strength, more had a share
in the government; and this is the reason why the states which we call
constitutional governments have been hitherto called democracies. Ancient constitutions, as might be expected, were oligarchical and royal;
their population being small they had no considerable middle class; the
people were weak in numbers and organization, and were therefore more
contented to be governed.
I have explained why there are various forms of government, and
why there are more than is generally supposed; for democracy, as well
as other constitutions, has more than one form: also what their differences are, and whence they arise, and what is the best form of government, speaking generally and to whom the various forms of government
are best suited; all this has now been explained.
Part XIV
Having thus gained an appropriate basis of discussion, we will proceed
to speak of the points which follow next in order. We will consider the
subject not only in general but with reference to particular constitutions. All constitutions have three elements, concerning which the good
lawgiver has to regard what is expedient for each constitution. When
they are well-ordered, the constitution is well-ordered, and as they differ
from one another, constitutions differ. There is (1) one element which
deliberates about public affairs; secondly (2) that concerned with the
magistrates—the question being, what they should be, over what they
should exercise authority, and what should be the mode of electing to
them; and thirdly (3) that which has judicial power.
The deliberative element has authority in matters of war and peace,
in making and unmaking alliances; it passes laws, inflicts death, exile,
confiscation, elects magistrates and audits their accounts. These powers
must be assigned either all to all the citizens or an to some of them (for
example, to one or more magistracies, or different causes to different
magistracies), or some of them to all, and others of them only to some.
That all things should be decided by all is characteristic of democracy;
Politics/101
this is the sort of equality which the people desire. But there are various
ways in which all may share in the government; they may deliberate, not
all in one body, but by turns, as in the constitution of Telecles the Milesian.
There are other constitutions in which the boards of magistrates meet
and deliberate, but come into office by turns, and are elected out of the
tribes and the very smallest divisions of the state, until every one has
obtained office in his turn. The citizens, on the other hand, are assembled
only for the purposes of legislation, and to consult about the constitution, and to hear the edicts of the magistrates. In another variety of
democracy the citizen form one assembly, but meet only to elect magistrates, to pass laws, to advise about war and peace, and to make scrutinies. Other matters are referred severally to special magistrates, who
are elected by vote or by lot out of all the citizens Or again, the citizens
meet about election to offices and about scrutinies, and deliberate concerning war or alliances while other matters are administered by the
magistrates, who, as far as is possible, are elected by vote. I am speaking of those magistracies in which special knowledge is required. A
fourth form of democracy is when all the citizens meet to deliberate
about everything, and the magistrates decide nothing, but only make the
preliminary inquiries; and that is the way in which the last and worst
form of democracy, corresponding, as we maintain, to the close family
oligarchy and to tyranny, is at present administered. All these modes are
democratical.
On the other hand, that some should deliberate about all is oligarchical. This again is a mode which, like the democratical has many
forms. When the deliberative class being elected out of those who have
a moderate qualification are numerous and they respect and obey the
prohibitions of the law without altering it, and any one who has the
required qualification shares in the government, then, just because of
this moderation, the oligarchy inclines towards polity. But when only
selected individuals and not the whole people share in the deliberations
of the state, then, although, as in the former case, they observe the law,
the government is a pure oligarchy. Or, again, when those who have the
power of deliberation are self-elected, and son succeeds father, and they
and not the laws are supreme—the government is of necessity oligarchical. Where, again, particular persons have authority in particular matters—for example, when the whole people decide about peace and war
and hold scrutinies, but the magistrates regulate everything else, and
they are elected by vote—there the government is an aristocracy. And if
102/Aristotle
some questions are decided by magistrates elected by vote, and others
by magistrates elected by lot, either absolutely or out of select candidates, or elected partly by vote, partly by lot—these practices are partly
characteristic of an aristocratical government, and party of a pure constitutional government.
These are the various forms of the deliberative body; they correspond to the various forms of government. And the government of each
state is administered according to one or other of the principles which
have been laid down. Now it is for the interest of democracy, according
to the most prevalent notion of it (I am speaking of that extreme form of
democracy in which the people are supreme even over the laws), with a
view to better deliberation to adopt the custom of oligarchies respecting
courts of law. For in oligarchies the rich who are wanted to be judges
are compelled to attend under pain of a fine, whereas in deinocracies the
poor are paid to attend. And this practice of oligarchies should be adopted
by democracies in their public assemblies, for they will advise better if
they all deliberate together—the people with the notables and the notables with the people. It is also a good plan that those who deliberate
should be elected by vote or by lot in equal numbers out of the different
classes; and that if the people greatly exceed in number those who have
political training, pay should not be given to all, but only to as many as
would balance the number of the notables, or that the number in excess
should be eliminated by lot. But in oligarchies either certain persons
should be co-opted from the mass, or a class of officers should be appointed such as exist in some states who are termed probuli and guardians of the law; and the citizens should occupy themselves exclusively
with matters on which these have previously deliberated; for so the people
will have a share in the deliberations of the state, but will not be able to
disturb the principles of the constitution. Again, in oligarchies either the
people ought to accept the measures of the government, or not to pass
anything contrary to them; or, if all are allowed to share in counsel, the
decision should rest with the magistrates. The opposite of what is done
in constitutional governments should be the rule in oligarchies; the veto
of the majority should be final, their assent not final, but the proposal
should be referred back to the magistrates. Whereas in constitutional
governments they take the contrary course; the few have the negative,
not the affirmative power; the affirmation of everything rests with the
multitude.
These, then, are our conclusions respecting the deliberative, that is,
Politics/103
the supreme element in states.
Part XV
Next we will proceed to consider the distribution of offices; this too,
being a part of politics concerning which many questions arise: What
shall their number be? Over what shall they preside, and what shall be
their duration? Sometimes they last for six months, sometimes for less;
sometimes they are annual, while in other cases offices are held for still
longer periods. Shall they be for life or for a long term of years; or, if for
a short term only, shall the same persons hold them over and over again,
or once only? Also about the appointment to them—from whom are
they to be chosen, by whom, and how? We should first be in a position
to say what are the possible varieties of them, and then we may proceed
to determine which are suited to different forms of government. But
what are to be included under the term ‘offices’? That is a question not
quite so easily answered. For a political community requires many officers; and not every one who is chosen by vote or by lot is to be regarded as a ruler. In the first place there are the priests, who must be
distinguished from political officers; masters of choruses and heralds,
even ambassadors, are elected by vote. Some duties of superintendence
again are political, extending either to all the citizens in a single sphere
of action, like the office of the general who superintends them when they
are in the field, or to a section of them only, like the inspectorships of
women or of youth. Other offices are concerned with household management, like that of the corn measurers who exist in many states and
are elected officers. There are also menial offices which the rich have
executed by their slaves. Speaking generally, those are to be called offices to which the duties are assigned of deliberating about certain measures and ofjudging and commanding, especially the last; for to command is the especial duty of a magistrate. But the question is not of any
importance in practice; no one has ever brought into court the meaning
of the word, although such problems have a speculative interest.
What kinds of offices, and how many, are necessary to the existence
of a state, and which, if not necessary, yet conduce to its well being are
much more important considerations, affecting all constitutions, but more
especially small states. For in great states it is possible, and indeed necessary, that every office should have a special function; where the citizens are numerous, many may hold office. And so it happens that some
offices a man holds a second time only after a long interval, and others
104/Aristotle
he holds once only; and certainly every work is better done which receives the sole, and not the divided attention of the worker. But in small
states it is necessary to combine many offices in a few hands, since the
small number of citizens does not admit of many holding office: for who
will there be to succeed them? And yet small states at times require the
same offices and laws as large ones; the difference is that the one want
them often, the others only after long intervals. Hence there is no reason
why the care of many offices should not be imposed on the same person,
for they will not interfere with each other. When the population is small,
offices should be like the spits which also serve to hold a lamp. We must
first ascertain how many magistrates are necessary in every state, and
also how many are not exactly necessary, but are nevertheless useful,
and then there will be no difficulty in seeing what offices can be combined in one. We should also know over which matters several local
tribunals are to have jurisdiction, and in which authority should be centralized: for example, should one person keep order in the market and
another in some other place, or should the same person be responsible
everywhere? Again, should offices be divided according to the subjects
with which they deal, or according to the persons with whom they deal:
I mean to say, should one person see to good order in general, or one
look after the boys, another after the women, and so on? Further, under
different constitutions, should the magistrates be the same or different?
For example, in democracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, monarchy, should
there be the same magistrates, although they are elected, not out of equal
or similar classes of citizen but differently under different constitutions—
in aristocracies, for example, they are chosen from the educated, in oligarchies from the wealthy, and in democracies from the free—or are
there certain differences in the offices answering to them as well, and
may the same be suitable to some, but different offices to others? For in
some states it may be convenient that the same office should have a
more extensive, in other states a narrower sphere. Special offices are
peculiar to certain forms of government: for example that of probuli,
which is not a democratic office, although a bule or council is. There
must be some body of men whose duty is to prepare measures for the
people in order that they may not be diverted from their business; when
these are few in number, the state inclines to an oligarchy: or rather the
probuli must always be few, and are therefore an oligarchical element.
But when both institutions exist in a state, the probuli are a check on the
council; for the counselors is a democratic element, but the probuli are
Politics/105
oligarchical. Even the power of the council disappears when democracy
has taken that extreme form in which the people themselves are always
meeting and deliberating about everything. This is the case when the
members of the assembly receive abundant pay; for they have nothing
to do and are always holding assemblies and deciding everything for
themselves. A magistracy which controls the boys or the women, or any
similar office, is suited to an aristocracy rather than to a democracy; for
how can the magistrates prevent the wives of the poor from going out of
doors? Neither is it an oligarchical office; for the wives of the oligarchs
are too fine to be controlled.
Enough of these matters. I will now inquire into appointments to
offices. The varieties depend on three terms, and the combinations of
these give all possible modes: first, who appoints? secondly, from whom?
and thirdly, how? Each of these three admits of three varieties: (A) All
the citizens, or (B) only some, appoint. Either (1) the magistrates are
chosen out of all or (2) out of some who are distinguished either by a
property qualification, or by birth, or merit, or for some special reason,
as at Megara only those were eligible who had returned from exile and
fought together against the democracy. They may be appointed either
(a) by vote or (b) by lot. Again, these several varieties may be coupled,
I mean that (C) some officers may be elected by some, others by all, and
(3) some again out of some, and others out of all, and (c) some by vote
and others by lot. Each variety of these terms admits of four modes.
For either (A 1 a) all may appoint from all by vote, or (A 1 b) all
from all by lot, or (A 2 a) all from some by vote, or (A 2 b) all from
some by lot (and from all, either by sections, as, for example, by tribes,
and wards, and phratries, until all the citizens have been gone through;
or the citizens may be in all cases eligible indiscriminately); or again (A
1 c, A 2 c) to some offices in the one way, to some in the other. Again, if
it is only some that appoint, they may do so either (B 1 a) from all by
vote, or (B 1 b) from all by lot, or (B 2 a) from some by vote, or (B 2 b)
from some by lot, or to some offices in the one way, to others in the
other, i.e., (B 1 c) from all, to some offices by vote, to some by lot, and
(B 2 C) from some, to some offices by vote, to some by lot. Thus the
modes that arise, apart from two (C, 3) out of the three couplings, number twelve. Of these systems two are popular, that all should appoint
from all (A 1 a) by vote or (A 1 b) by lot—or (A 1 c) by both. That all
should not appoint at once, but should appoint from all or from some
either by lot or by vote or by both, or appoint to some offices from all
106/Aristotle
and to others from some (‘by both’ meaning to some offices by lot, to
others by vote), is characteristic of a polity. And (B 1 c) that some
should appoint from all, to some offices by vote, to others by lot, is also
characteristic of a polity, but more oligarchical than the former method.
And (A 3 a, b, c, B 3 a, b, c) to appoint from both, to some offices from
all, to others from some, is characteristic of a polity with a leaning
towards aristocracy. That (B 2) some should appoint from some is oligarchical—even (B 2 b) that some should appoint from some by lot
(and if this does not actually occur, it is none the less oligarchical in
character), or (B 2 C) that some should appoint from some by both. (B
1 a) that some should appoint from all, and (A 2 a) that all should
appoint from some, by vote, is aristocratic.
These are the different modes of constituting magistrates, and these
correspond to different forms of government: which are proper to which,
or how they ought to be established, will be evident when we determine
the nature of their powers. By powers I mean such powers as a magistrate exercises over the revenue or in defense of the country; for there
are various kinds of power: the power of the general, for example, is not
the same with that which regulates contracts in the market.
Part XVI
Of the three parts of government, the judicial remains to be considered,
and this we shall divide on the same principle. There are three points on
which the variedes of law-courts depend: The persons from whom they
are appointed, the matters with which they are concerned, and the manner of their appointment. I mean, (1) are the judges taken from all, or
from some only? (2) how many kinds of law-courts are there? (3) are
the judges chosen by vote or by lot?
First, let me determine how many kinds of law-courts there are.
There are eight in number: One is the court of audits or scrutinies; a
second takes cognizance of ordinary offenses against the state; a third is
concerned with treason against the constitution; the fourth determines
disputes respecting penalties, whether raised by magistrates or by private persons; the fifth decides the more important civil cases; the sixth
tries cases of homicide, which are of various kinds, (a) premeditated,
(b) involuntary, (c) cases in which the guilt is confessed but the justice is
disputed; and there may be a fourth court (d) in which murderers who
have fled from justice are tried after their return; such as the Court of
Phreatto is said to be at Athens. But cases of this sort rarely happen at
Politics/107
all even in large cities. The different kinds of homicide may be tried
either by the same or by different courts. (7) There are courts for strangers: of these there are two subdivisions, (a) for the settlement of their
disputes with one another, (b) for the settlement of disputes between
them and the citizens. And besides all these there must be (8) courts for
small suits about sums of a drachma up to five drachmas, or a little
more, which have to be determined, but they do not require many judges.
Nothing more need be said of these small suits, nor of the courts for
homicide and for strangers: I would rather speak of political cases, which,
when mismanaged, create division and disturbances in constitutions.
Now if all the citizens judge, in all the different cases which I have
distinguished, they may be appointed by vote or by lot, or sometimes by
lot and sometimes by vote. Or when a single class of causes are tried,
the judges who decide them may be appointed, some by vote, and some
by lot. These then are the four modes of appointing judges from the
whole people, and there will be likewise four modes, if they are elected
from a part only; for they may be appointed from some by vote and
judge in all causes; or they may be appointed from some by lot and
judge in all causes; or they may be elected in some cases by vote, and in
some cases taken by lot, or some courts, even when judging the same
causes, may be composed of members some appointed by vote and some
by lot. These modes, then, as was said, answer to those previously mentioned.
Once more, the modes of appointment may be combined; I mean,
that some may be chosen out of the whole people, others out of some,
some out of both; for example, the same tribunal may be composed of
some who were elected out of all, and of others who were elected out of
some, either by vote or by lot or by both.
In how many forms law-courts can be established has now been
considered. The first form, viz., that in which the judges are taken from
all the citizens, and in which all causes are tried, is democratical; the
second, which is composed of a few only who try all causes, oligarchical; the third, in which some courts are taken from all classes, and some
from certain classes only, aristocratical and constitutional.
108/Aristotle
BOOK FIVE
Part I
The design which we proposed to ourselves is now nearly completed.
Next in order follow the causes of revolution in states, how many, and
of what nature they are; what modes of destruction apply to particular
states, and out of what, and into what they mostly change; also what are
the modes of preservation in states generally, or in a particular state,
and by what means each state may be best preserved: these questions
remain to be considered.
In the first place we must assume as our starting-point that in the
many forms of government which have sprung up there has always been
an acknowledgment of justice and proportionate equality, although mankind fail attaining them, as I have already explained. Democracy, for
example, arises out of the notion that those who are equal in any respect
are equal in all respects; because men are equally free, they claim to be
absolutely equal. Oligarchy is based on the notion that those who are
unequal in one respect are in all respects unequal; being unequal, that is,
in property, they suppose themselves to be unequal absolutely. The democrats think that as they are equal they ought to be equal in all things;
while the oligarchs, under the idea that they are unequal, claim too much,
which is one form of inequality. All these forms of government have a
kind of justice, but, tried by an absolute standard, they are faulty; and,
therefore, both parties, whenever their share in the government does not
accord with their preconceived ideas, stir up revolution. Those who excel in virtue have the best right of all to rebel (for they alone can with
reason be deemed absolutely unequal), but then they are of all men the
least inclined to do so. There is also a superiority which is claimed by
men of rank; for they are thought noble because they spring from wealthy
and virtuous ancestors. Here then, so to speak, are opened the very
springs and fountains of revolution; and hence arise two sorts of changes
in governments; the one affecting the constitution, when men seek to
change from an existing form into some other, for example, from democracy into oligarchy, and from oligarchy into democracy, or from
either of them into constitutional government or aristocracy, and conversely; the other not affecting the constitution, when, without disturbing the form of government, whether oligarchy, or monarchy, or any
other, they try to get the administration into their own hands. Further,
there is a question of degree; an oligarchy, for example, may become
more or less oligarchical, and a democracy more or less democratical;
Politics/109
and in like manner the characteristics of the other forms of government
may be more or less strictly maintained. Or the revolution may be directed against a portion of the constitution only, e.g., the establishment
or overthrow of a particular office: as at Sparta it is said that Lysander
attempted to overthrow the monarchy, and King Pausanias, the Ephoralty.
At Epidamnus, too, the change was partial. For instead of phylarchs or
heads of tribes, a council was appointed; but to this day the magistrates
are the only members of the ruling class who are compelled to go to the
Heliaea when an election takes place, and the office of the single archon
was another oligarchical feature. Everywhere inequality is a cause of
revolution, but an inequality in which there is no proportion—for instance, a perpetual monarchy among equals; and always it is the desire
of equality which rises in rebellion.
Now equality is of two kinds, numerical and proportional; by the
first I mean sameness or equality in number or size; by the second,
equality of ratios. For example, the excess of three over two is numerically equal to the excess of two over one; whereas four exceeds two in
the same ratio in which two exceeds one, for two is the same part of four
that one is of two, namely, the half. As I was saying before, men agree
that justice in the abstract is proportion, but they differ in that some
think that if they are equal in any respect they are equal absolutely,
others that if they are unequal in any respect they should be unequal in
all. Hence there are two principal forms of government, democracy and
oligarchy; for good birth and virtue are rare, but wealth and numbers
are more common. In what city shall we find a hundred persons of good
birth and of virtue? whereas the rich everywhere abound. That a state
should be ordered, simply and wholly, according to either kind of equality, is not a good thing; the proof is the fact that such forms of government never last. They are originally based on a mistake, and, as they
begin badly, cannot fall to end badly. The inference is that both kinds of
equality should be employed; numerical in some cases, and proportionate in others.
Still democracy appears to be safer and less liable to revolution
than oligarchy. For in oligarchies there is the double danger of the oligarchs falling out among themselves and also with the people; but in
democracies there is only the danger of a quarrel with the oligarchs. No
dissension worth mentioning arises among the people themselves. And
we may further remark that a government which is composed of the
middle class more nearly approximates to democracy than to oligarchy,
110/Aristotle
and is the safest of the imperfect forms of government.
Part II
In considering how dissensions and poltical revolutions arise, we must
first of all ascertain the beginnings and causes of them which affect
constitutions generally. They may be said to be three in number; and we
have now to give an outline of each. We want to know (1) what is the
feeling? (2) what are the motives of those who make them? (3) whence
arise political disturbances and quarrels? The universal and chief cause
of this revolutionary feeling has been already mentioned; viz., the desire
of equality, when men think that they are equal to others who have more
than themselves; or, again, the desire of inequality and superiority, when
conceiving themselves to be superior they think that they have not more
but the same or less than their inferiors; pretensions which may and may
not be just. Inferiors revolt in order that they may be equal, and equals
that they may be superior. Such is the state of mind which creates revolutions. The motives for making them are the desire of gain and honor,
or the fear of dishonor and loss; the authors of them want to divert
punishment or dishonor from themselves or their friends. The causes
and reasons of revolutions, whereby men are themselves affected in the
way described, and about the things which I have mentioned, viewed in
one way may be regarded as seven, and in another as more than seven.
Two of them have been already noticed; but they act in a different manner, for men are excited against one another by the love of gain and
honor—not, as in the case which I have just supposed, in order to obtain
them for themselves, but at seeing others, justly or unjustly, engrossing
them. Other causes are insolence, fear, excessive predominance, contempt, disproportionate increase in some part of the state; causes of
another sort are election intrigues, carelessness, neglect about trifles,
dissimilarity of elements.
Part III
What share insolence and avarice have in creating revolutions, and how
they work, is plain enough. When the magistrates are insolent and grasping they conspire against one another and also against the constitution
from which they derive their power, making their gains either at the
expense of individuals or of the public. It is evident, again, what an
influence honor exerts and how it is a cause of revolution. Men who are
themselves dishonored and who see others obtaining honors rise in re-
Politics/111
bellion; the honor or dishonor when undeserved is unjust; and just when
awarded according to merit.
Again, superiority is a cause of revolution when one or more persons have a power which is too much for the state and the power of the
government; this is a condition of affairs out of which there arises a
monarchy, or a family oligarchy. And therefore, in some places, as at
Athens and Argos, they have recourse to ostracism. But how much better to provide from the first that there should be no such pre-eminent
individuals instead of letting them come into existence and then finding
a remedy.
Another cause of revolution is fear. Either men have committed
wrong, and are afraid of punishment, or they are expecting to suffer
wrong and are desirous of anticipating their enemy. Thus at Rhodes the
notables conspired against the people through fear of the suits that were
brought against them. Contempt is also a cause of insurrection and revolution; for example, in oligarchies—when those who have no share in
the state are the majority, they revolt, because they think that they are
the stronger. Or, again, in democracies, the rich despise the disorder and
anarchy of the state; at Thebes, for example, where, after the battle of
Oenophyta, the bad administration of the democracy led to its ruin. At
Megara the fall of the democracy was due to a defeat occasioned by
disorder and anarchy. And at Syracuse the democracy aroused contempt
before the tyranny of Gelo arose; at Rhodes, before the insurrection.
Political revolutions also spring from a disproportionate increase in
any part of the state. For as a body is made up of many members, and
every member ought to grow in proportion, that symmetry may be preserved; but loses its nature if the foot be four cubits long and the rest of
the body two spans; and, should the abnormal increase be one of quality
as well as of quantity, may even take the form of another animal: even
so a state has many parts, of which some one may often grow imperceptibly; for example, the number of poor in democracies and in constitutional states. And this disproportion may sometimes happen by an accident, as at Tarentum, from a defeat in which many of the notables were
slain in a battle with the Iapygians just after the Persian War, the constitutional government in consequence becoming a democracy; or as was
the case at Argos, where the Argives, after their army had been cut to
pieces on the seventh day of the month by Cleomenes the Lacedaemonian,
were compelled to admit to citizen some of their Perioeci; and at Athens, when, after frequent defeats of their infantry at the time of the
112/Aristotle
Peloponnesian War, the notables were reduced in number, because the
soldiers had to be taken from the roll of citizens. Revolutions arise from
this cause as well, in democracies as in other forms of government, but
not to so great an extent. When the rich grow numerous or properties
increase, the form of government changes into an oligarchy or a government of families. Forms of government also change—sometimes even
without revolution, owing to election contests, as at Heraea (where, instead of electing their magistrates, they took them by lot, because the
electors were in the habit of choosing their own partisans); or owing to
carelessness, when disloyal persons are allowed to find their way into
the highest offices, as at Oreum, where, upon the accession of
Heracleodorus to office, the oligarchy was overthrown, and changed by
him into a constitutional and democratical government.
Again, the revolution may be facilitated by the slightness of the
change; I mean that a great change may sometimes slip into the constitution through neglect of a small matter; at Ambracia, for instance, the
qualification for office, small at first, was eventually reduced to nothing. For the Ambraciots thought that a small qualification was much the
same as none at all.
Another cause of revolution is difference of races which do not at
once acquire a common spirit; for a state is not the growth of a day, any
more than it grows out of a multitude brought together by accident.
Hence the reception of strangers in colonies, either at the time of their
foundation or afterwards, has generally produced revolution; for example, the Achaeans who joined the Troezenians in the foundation of
Sybaris, becoming later the more numerous, expelled them; hence the
curse fell upon Sybaris. At Thurii the Sybarites quarrelled with their
fellow-colonists; thinking that the land belonged to them, they wanted
too much of it and were driven out. At Byzantium the new colonists
were detected in a conspiracy, and were expelled by force of arms; the
people of Antissa, who had received the Chian exiles, fought with them,
and drove them out; and the Zancleans, after having received the Samians,
were driven by them out of their own city. The citizens of Apollonia on
the Euxine, after the introduction of a fresh body of colonists, had a
revolution; the Syracusans, after the expulsion of their tyrants, having
admitted strangers and mercenaries to the rights of citizenship, quarrelled and came to blows; the people of Amphipolis, having received
Chalcidian colonists, were nearly all expelled by them.
Now, in oligarchies the masses make revolution under the idea that
Politics/113
they are unjustly treated, because, as I said before, they are equals, and
have not an equal share, and in democracies the notables revolt, because
they are not equals, and yet have only an equal share.
Again, the situation of cities is a cause of revolution when the country is not naturally adapted to preserve the unity of the state. For example, the Chytians at Clazomenae did not agree with the people of the
island; and the people of Colophon quarrelled with the Notians; at Athens too, the inhabitants of the Piraeus are more democratic than those
who live in the city. For just as in war the impediment of a ditch, though
ever so small, may break a regiment, so every cause of difference, however slight, makes a breach in a city. The greatest opposition is confessedly that of virtue and vice; next comes that of wealth and poverty; and
there are other antagonistic elements, greater or less, of which one is
this difference of place.
Part IV
In revolutions the occasions may be trifling, but great interests are at
stake. Even trifles are most important when they concern the rulers, as
was the case of old at Syracuse; for the Syracusan constitution was
once changed by a love-quarrel of two young men, who were in the
government. The story is that while one of them was away from home
his beloved was gained over by his companion, and he to revenge himself seduced the other’s wife. They then drew the members of the ruling
class into their quarrel and so split all the people into portions. We learn
from this story that we should be on our guard against the beginnings of
such evils, and should put an end to the quarrels of chiefs and mighty
men. The mistake lies in the beginning—as the proverb says—‘Well
begun is half done’; so an error at the beginning, though quite small,
bears the same ratio to the errors in the other parts. In general, when the
notables quarrel, the whole city is involved, as happened in Hesdaea
after the Persian War. The occasion was the division of an inheritance;
one of two brothers refused to give an account of their father’s property
and the treasure which he had found: so the poorer of the two quarrelled
with him and enlisted in his cause the popular party, the other, who was
very rich, the wealthy classes.
At Delphi, again, a quarrel about a marriage was the beginning of
all the troubles which followed. In this case the bridegroom, fancying
some occurrence to be of evil omen, came to the bride, and went away
without taking her. Whereupon her relations, thinking that they were
114/Aristotle
insulted by him, put some of the sacred treasure among his offerings
while he was sacrificing, and then slew him, pretending that he had been
robbing the temple. At Mytilene, too, a dispute about heiresses was the
beginning of many misfortunes, and led to the war with the Athenians in
which Paches took their city. A wealthy citizen, named Timophanes, left
two daughters; Dexander, another citizen, wanted to obtain them for his
sons; but he was rejected in his suit, whereupon he stirred up a revolution, and instigated the Athenians (of whom he was proxenus) to interfere. A similar quarrel about an heiress arose at Phocis between Mnaseas
the father of Mnason, and Euthycrates the father of Onomarchus; this
was the beginning of the Sacred War. A marriage-quarrel was also the
cause of a change in the government of Epidamnus. A certain man betrothed his daughter to a person whose father, having been made a magistrate, fined the father of the girl, and the latter, stung by the insult,
conspired with the unenfranchised classes to overthrow the state.
Governments also change into oligarchy or into democracy or into a
constitutional government because the magistrates, or some other section of the state, increase in power or renown. Thus at Athens the reputation gained by the court of the Areopagus, in the Persian War, seemed
to tighten the reins of government. On the other hand, the victory of
Salamis, which was gained by the common people who served in the
fleet, and won for the Athenians the empire due to command of the sea,
strengthened the democracy. At Argos, the notables, having distinguished
themselves against the Lacedaemonians in the battle of Mantinea, attempted to put down the democracy. At Syracuse, the people, having
been the chief authors of the victory in the war with the Athenians,
changed the constitutional government into democracy. At Chalcis, the
people, uniting with the notables, killed Phoxus the tyrant, and then
seized the government. At Ambracia, the people, in like manner, having
joined with the conspirators in expelling the tyrant Periander, transferred the government to themselves. And generally it should be remembered that those who have secured power to the state, whether private
citizens, or magistrates, or tribes, or any other part or section of the
state, are apt to cause revolutions. For either envy of their greatness
draws others into rebellion, or they themselves, in their pride of superiority, are unwilling to remain on a level with others.
Revolutions also break out when opposite parties, e.g., the rich and
the people, are equally balanced, and there is little or no middle class;
for, if either party were manifestly superior, the other would not risk an
Politics/115
attack upon them. And, for this reason, those who are eminent in virtue
usually do not stir up insurrections, always being a minority. Such are
the beginnings and causes of the disturbances and revolutions to which
every form of government is liable.
Revolutions are effected in two ways, by force and by fraud. Force
may be applied either at the time of making the revolution or afterwards. Fraud, again, is of two kinds; for (1) sometimes the citizens are
deceived into acquiescing in a change of government, and afterwards
they are held in subjection against their will. This was what happened in
the case of the Four Hundred, who deceived the people by telling them
that the king would provide money for the war against the
Lacedaemonians, and, having cheated the people, still endeavored to
retain the government. (2) In other cases the people are persuaded at
first, and afterwards, by a repetition of the persuasion, their goodwill
and allegiance are retained. The revolutions which effect constitutions
generally spring from the above-mentioned causes.
Part V
And now, taking each constitution separately, we must see what follows
from the principles already laid down.
Revolutions in democracies are generally caused by the intemperance of demagogues, who either in their private capacity lay information against rich men until they compel them to combine (for a common
danger unites even the bitterest enemies), or coming forward in public
stir up the people against them. The truth of this remark is proved by a
variety of examples. At Cos the democracy was overthrown because
wicked demagogues arose, and the notables combined. At Rhodes the
demagogues not only provided pay for the multitude, but prevented them
from making good to the trierarchs the sums which had been expended
by them; and they, in consequence of the suits which were brought against
them, were compelled to combine and put down the democracy. The
democracy at Heraclea was overthrown shortly after the foundation of
the colony by the injustice of the demagogues, which drove out the notables, who came back in a body and put an end to the democracy. Much
in the same manner the democracy at Megara was overturned; there the
demagogues drove out many of the notables in order that they might be
able to confiscate their property. At length the exiles, becoming numerous, returned, and, engaging and defeating the people, established the
oligarchy. The same thing happened with the democracy of Cyme, which
116/Aristotle
was overthrown by Thrasymachus. And we may observe that in most
states the changes have been of this character. For sometimes the demagogues, in order to curry favor with the people, wrong the notables and
so force them to combine; either they make a division of their property,
or diminish their incomes by the imposition of public services, and sometimes they bring accusations against the rich that they may have their
wealth to confiscate.
Of old, the demagogue was also a general, and then democracies
changed into tyrannies. Most of the ancient tyrants were originally demagogues. They are not so now, but they were then; and the reason is that
they were generals and not orators, for oratory had not yet come into
fashion. Whereas in our day, when the art of rhetoric has made such
progress, the orators lead the people, but their ignorance of military
matters prevents them from usurping power; at any rate instances to the
contrary are few and slight. Tyrannies were more common formerly
than now, for this reason also, that great power was placed in the hands
of individuals; thus a tyranny arose at Miletus out of the office of the
Prytanis, who had supreme authority in many important matters. Moreover, in those days, when cities were not large, the people dwelt in the
fields, busy at their work; and their chiefs, if they possessed any military talent, seized the opportunity, and winning the confidence of the
masses by professing their hatred of the wealthy, they succeeded in obtaining the tyranny. Thus at Athens Peisistratus led a faction against the
men of the plain, and Theagenes at Megara slaughtered the cattle of the
wealthy, which he found by the river side, where they had put them to
graze in land not their own. Dionysius, again, was thought worthy of
the tyranny because he denounced Daphnaeus and the rich; his enmity
to the notables won for him the confidence of the people. Changes also
take place from the ancient to the latest form of democracy; for where
there is a popular election of the magistrates and no property qualification, the aspirants for office get hold of the people, and contrive at last
even to set them above the laws. A more or less complete cure for this
state of things is for the separate tribes, and not the whole people, to
elect the magistrates.
These are the principal causes of revolutions in democracies.
Politics/117
Part VI
There are two patent causes of revolutions in oligarchies: (1) First, when
the oligarchs oppress the people, for then anybody is good enough to be
their champion, especially if he be himself a member of the oligarchy, as
Lygdamis at Naxos, who afterwards came to be tyrant. But revolutions
which commence outside the governing class may be further subdivided.
Sometimes, when the government is very exclusive, the revolution is
brought about by persons of the wealthy class who are excluded, as
happened at Massalia and Istros and Heraclea, and other cities. Those
who had no share in the government created a disturbance, until first the
elder brothers, and then the younger, were admitted; for in some places
father and son, in others elder and younger brothers, do not hold office
together. At Massalia the oligarchy became more like a constitutional
government, but at Istros ended in a democracy, and at Heraclea was
enlarged to 600. At Cnidos, again, the oligarchy underwent a considerable change. For the notables fell out among themselves, because only a
few shared in the government; there existed among them the rule already mentioned, that father and son not hold office together, and, if
there were several brothers, only the eldest was admitted. The people
took advantage of the quarrel, and choosing one of the notables to be
their leader, attacked and conquered the oligarchs, who were divided,
and division is always a source of weakness. The city of Erythrae, too,
in old times was ruled, and ruled well, by the Basilidae, but the people
took offense at the narrowness of the oligarchy and changed the constitution.
(2) Of internal causes of revolutions in oligarchies one is the personal rivalry of the oligarchs, which leads them to play the demagogue.
Now, the oligarchical demagogue is of two sorts: either (a) he practices
upon the oligarchs themselves (for, although the oligarchy are quite a
small number, there may be a demagogue among them, as at Athens
Charicles’ party won power by courting the Thirty, that of Phrynichus
by courting the Four Hundred); or (b) the oligarchs may play the demagogue with the people. This was the case at Larissa, where the guardians of the citizens endeavored to gain over the people because they
were elected by them; and such is the fate of all oligarchies in which the
magistrates are elected, as at Abydos, not by the class to which they
belong, but by the heavy-armed or by the people, although they may be
required to have a high qualification, or to be members of a political
club; or, again, where the law-courts are composed of persons outside
118/Aristotle
the government, the oligarchs flatter the people in order to obtain a
decision in their own favor, and so they change the constitution; this
happened at Heraclea in Pontus. Again, oligarchies change whenever
any attempt is made to narrow them; for then those who desire equal
rights are compelled to call in the people. Changes in the oligarchy also
occur when the oligarchs waste their private property by extravagant
living; for then they want to innovate, and either try to make themselves
tyrants, or install some one else in the tyranny, as Hipparinus did
Dionysius at Syracuse, and as at Amphipolis a man named Cleotimus
introduced Chalcidian colonists, and when they arrived, stirred them up
against the rich. For a like reason in Aegina the person who carried on
the negotiation with Chares endeavored to revolutionize the state. Sometimes a party among the oligarchs try directly to create a political change;
sometimes they rob the treasury, and then either the thieves or, as happened at Apollonia in Pontus, those who resist them in their thieving
quarrel with the rulers. But an oligarchy which is at unity with itself is
not easily destroyed from within; of this we may see an example at
Pharsalus, for there, although the rulers are few in number, they govern
a large city, because they have a good understanding among themselves.
Oligarchies, again, are overthrown when another oligarchy is created within the original one, that is to say, when the whole governing
body is small and yet they do not all share in the highest offices. Thus at
Elis the governing body was a small senate; and very few ever found
their way into it, because the senators were only ninety in number, and
were elected for life and out of certain families in a manner similar to
the Lacedaemonian elders. Oligarchy is liable to revolutions alike in
war and in peace; in war because, not being able to trust the people, the
oligarchs are compelled to hire mercenaries, and the general who is in
command of them often ends in becoming a tyrant, as Timophanes did
at Corinth; or if there are more generals than one they make themselves
into a company of tyrants. Sometimes the oligarchs, fearing this danger,
give the people a share in the government because their services are
necessary to them. And in time of peace, from mutual distrust, the two
parties hand over the defense of the state to the army and to an arbiter
between the two factions, who often ends the master of both. This happened at Larissa when Simos the Aleuad had the government, and at
Abydos in the days of Iphiades and the political clubs. Revolutions also
arise out of marriages or lawsuits which lead to the overthrow of one
party among the oligarchs by another. Of quarrels about marriages I
Politics/119
have already mentioned some instances; another occurred at Eretria,
where Diagoras overturned the oligarchy of the knights because he had
been wronged about a marriage. A revolution at Heraclea, and another
at Thebes, both arose out of decisions of law-courts upon a charge of
adultery; in both cases the punishment was just, but executed in the
spirit of party, at Heraclea upon Eurytion, and at Thebes upon Archias;
for their enemies were jealous of them and so had them pilloried in the
agora. Many oligarchies have been destroyed by some members of the
ruling class taking offense at their excessive despotism; for example,
the oligarchy at Cnidus and at Chios.
Changes of constitutional governments, and also of oligarchies which
limit the office of counselor, judge, or other magistrate to persons having a certain money qualification, often occur by accident. The qualification may have been originally fixed according to the circumstances of
the time, in such a manner as to include in an oligarchy a few only, or in
a constitutional government the middle class. But after a time of prosperity, whether arising from peace or some other good fortune, the same
property becomes many times as valuable, and then everybody participates in every office; this happens sometimes gradually and insensibly,
and sometimes quickly. These are the causes of changes and revolutions
in oligarchies.
We must remark generally both of democracies and oligarchies, that
they sometimes change, not into the opposite forms of government, but
only into another variety of the same class; I mean to say, from those
forms of democracy and oligarchy which are regulated by law into those
which are arbitrary, and conversely.
Part VII
In aristocracies revolutions are stirred up when a few only share in the
honors of the state; a cause which has been already shown to affect
oligarchies; for an aristocracy is a sort of oligarchy, and, like an oligarchy, is the government of a few, although few not for the same reason;
hence the two are often confounded. And revolutions will be most likely
to happen, and must happen, when the mass of the people are of the
high-spirited kind, and have a notion that they are as good as their rulers. Thus at Lacedaemon the so-called Partheniae, who were the [illegitimate] sons of the Spartan peers, attempted a revolution, and, being
detected, were sent away to colonize Tarentum. Again, revolutions occur when great men who are at least of equal merit are dishonored by
120/Aristotle
those higher in office, as Lysander was by the kings of Sparta; or, when
a brave man is excluded from the honors of the state, like Cinadon, who
conspired against the Spartans in the reign of Agesilaus; or, again, when
some are very poor and others very rich, a state of society which is most
often the result of war, as at Lacedaemon in the days of the Messenian
War; this is proved from the poem of Tyrtaeus, entitled ‘Good Order’;
for he speaks of certain citizens who were ruined by the war and wanted
to have a redistribution of the land. Again, revolutions arise when an
individual who is great, and might be greater, wants to rule alone, as, at
Lacedaemon, Pausanias, who was general in the Persian War, or like
Hanno at Carthage.
Constitutional governments and aristocracies are commonly overthrown owing to some deviation from justice in the constitution itself;
the cause of the downfall is, in the former, the ill-mingling of the two
elements, democracy and oligarchy; in the latter, of the three elements,
democracy, oligarchy, and virtue, but especially democracy and oligarchy. For to combine these is the endeavor of constitutional governments;
and most of the so-called aristocracies have a like aim, but differ from
polities in the mode of combination; hence some of them are more and
some less permanent. Those which incline more to oligarchy are called
aristocracies, and those which incline to democracy constitutional governments. And therefore the latter are the safer of the two; for the greater
the number, the greater the strength, and when men are equal they are
contented. But the rich, if the constitution gives them power, are apt to
be insolent and avaricious; and, in general, whichever way the constitution inclines, in that direction it changes as either party gains strength, a
constitutional government becoming a democracy, an aristocracy an
oligarchy. But the process may be reversed, and aristocracy may change
into democracy. This happens when the poor, under the idea that they
are being wronged, force the constitution to take an opposite form. In
like manner constitutional governments change into oligarchies. The only
stable principle of government is equality according to proportion, and
for every man to enjoy his own.
What I have just mentioned actually happened at Thurii, where the
qualification for office, at first high, was therefore reduced, and the
magistrates increased in number. The notables had previously acquired
the whole of the land contrary to law; for the government tended to
oligarchy, and they were able to encroach.... But the people, who had
been trained by war, soon got the better of the guards kept by the oli-
Politics/121
garchs, until those who had too much gave up their land.
Again, since all aristocratical governments incline to oligarchy, the
notables are apt to be grasping; thus at Lacedaemon, where property
tends to pass into few hands, the notables can do too much as they like,
and are allowed to marry whom they please. The city of Locri was
ruined by a marriage connection with Dionysius, but such a thing could
never have happened in a democracy, or in a wellbalanced aristocracy.
I have already remarked that in all states revolutions are occasioned
by trifles. In aristocracies, above all, they are of a gradual and imperceptible nature. The citizens begin by giving up some part of the constitution, and so with greater ease the government change something else
which is a little more important, until they have undermined the whole
fabric of the state. At Thurii there was a law that generals should only
be re-elected after an interval of five years, and some young men who
were popular with the soldiers of the guard for their military prowess,
despising the magistrates and thinking that they would easily gain their
purpose, wanted to abolish this law and allow their generals to hold
perpetual commands; for they well knew that the people would be glad
enough to elect them. Whereupon the magistrates who had charge of
these matters, and who are called councillors, at first determined to resist, but they afterwards consented, thinking that, if only this one law
was changed, no further inroad would be made on the constitution. But
other changes soon followed which they in vain attempted to oppose;
and the state passed into the hands of the revolutionists, who established
a dynastic oligarchy.
All constitutions are overthrown either from within or from without; the latter, when there is some government close at hand having an
opposite interest, or at a distance, but powerful. This was exemplified
in the old times of the Athenians and the Lacedaemonians; the Athenians everywhere put down the oligarchies, and the Lacedaemonians
the democracies.
I have now explained what are the chief causes of revolutions and
dissensions in states.
Part VIII
We have next to consider what means there are of preserving constitutions in general, and in particular cases. In the first place it is evident
that if we know the causes which destroy constitutions, we also know
the causes which preserve them; for opposites produce opposites, and
122/Aristotle
destruction is the opposite of preservation.
In all well-attempered governments there is nothing which should
be more jealously maintained than the spirit of obedience to law, more
especially in small matters; for transgression creeps in unperceived and
at last ruins the state, just as the constant recurrence of small expenses
in time eats up a fortune. The expense does not take place at once, and
therefore is not observed; the mind is deceived, as in the fallacy which
says that ‘if each part is little, then the whole is little.’ this is true in one
way, but not in another, for the whole and the all are not little, although
they are made up of littles.
In the first place, then, men should guard against the beginning of
change, and in the second place they should not rely upon the political
devices of which I have already spoken invented only to deceive the
people, for they are proved by experience to be useless. Further, we note
that oligarchies as well as aristocracies may last, not from any inherent
stability in such forms of government, but because the rulers are on
good terms both with the unenfranchised and with the governing classes,
not maltreating any who are excluded from the government, but introducing into it the leading spirits among them. They should never wrong
the ambitious in a matter of honor, or the common people in a matter of
money; and they should treat one another and their fellow citizen in a
spirit of equality. The equality which the friends of democracy seek to
establish for the multitude is not only just but likewise expedient among
equals. Hence, if the governing class are numerous, many democratic
institutions are useful; for example, the restriction of the tenure of offices to six months, that all those who are of equal rank may share in
them. Indeed, equals or peers when they are numerous become a kind of
democracy, and therefore demagogues are very likely to arise among
them, as I have already remarked. The short tenure of office prevents
oligarchies and aristocracies from falling into the hands of families; it is
not easy for a person to do any great harm when his tenure of office is
short, whereas long possession begets tyranny in oligarchies and democracies. For the aspirants to tyranny are either the principal men of
the state, who in democracies are demagogues and in oligarchies members of ruling houses, or those who hold great offices, and have a long
tenure of them.
Constitutions are preserved when their destroyers are at a distance,
and sometimes also because they are near, for the fear of them makes
the government keep in hand the constitution. Wherefore the ruler who
Politics/123
has a care of the constitution should invent terrors, and bring distant
dangers near, in order that the citizens may be on their guard, and, like
sentinels in a night watch, never relax their attention. He should endeavor too by help of the laws to control the contentions and quarrels of
the notables, and to prevent those who have not hitherto taken part in
them from catching the spirit of contention. No ordinary man can discern the beginning of evil, but only the true statesman.
As to the change produced in oligarchies and constitutional governments by the alteration of the qualification, when this arises, not out of
any variation in the qualification but only out of the increase of money,
it is well to compare the general valuation of property with that of past
years, annually in those cities in which the census is taken annually and
in larger cities every third or fifth year. If the whole is many times greater
or many times less than when the ratings recognized by the constitution
were fixed, there should be power given by law to raise or lower the
qualification as the amount is greater or less. Where this is not done a
constitutional government passes into an oligarchy, and an oligarchy is
narrowed to a rule of families; or in the opposite case constitutional
government becomes democracy, and oligarchy either constitutional
government or democracy.
It is a principle common to democracy, oligarchy, and every other
form of government not to allow the disproportionate increase of any
citizen but to give moderate honor for a long time rather than great
honor for a short time. For men are easily spoilt; not every one can bear
prosperity. But if this rule is not observed, at any rate the honors which
are given all at once should be taken away by degrees and not all at
once. Especially should the laws provide against any one having too
much power, whether derived from friends or money; if he has, he should
be sent clean out of the country. And since innovations creep in through
the private life of individuals also, there ought to be a magistracy which
will have an eye to those whose life is not in harmony with the government, whether oligarchy or democracy or any other. And for a like reason an increase of prosperity in any part of the state should be carefully
watched. The proper remedy for this evil is always to give the management of affairs and offices of state to opposite elements; such opposites
are the virtuous and the many, or the rich and the poor. Another way is
to combine the poor and the rich in one body, or to increase the middle
class: thus an end will be put to the revolutions which arise from inequality.
124/Aristotle
But above all every state should be so administered and so regulated by law that its magistrates cannot possibly make money. In oligarchies special precautions should be used against this evil. For the people
do not take any great offense at being kept out of the government—
indeed they are rather pleased than otherwise at having leisure for their
private business—but what irritates them is to think that their rulers are
stealing the public money; then they are doubly annoyed; for they lose
both honor and profit. If office brought no profit, then and then only
could democracy and aristocracy be combined; for both notables and
people might have their wishes gratified. All would be able to hold office, which is the aim of democracy, and the notables would be magistrates, which is the aim of aristocracy. And this result may be accomplished when there is no possibility of making money out of the offices;
for the poor will not want to have them when there is nothing to be
gained from them—they would rather be attending to their own concerns; and the rich, who do not want money from the public treasury,
will be able to take them; and so the poor will keep to their work and
grow rich, and the notables will not be governed by the lower class. In
order to avoid peculation of the public money, the transfer of the revenue should be made at a general assembly of the citizens, and duplicates of the accounts deposited with the different brotherhoods, companies, and tribes. And honors should be given by law to magistrates who
have the reputation of being incorruptible. In democracies the rich should
be spared; not only should their property not be divided, but their incomes also, which in some states are taken from them imperceptibly,
should be protected. It is a good thing to prevent the wealthy citizens,
even if they are willing from undertaking expensive and useless public
services, such as the giving of choruses, torch-races, and the like. In an
oligarchy, on the other hand, great care should be taken of the poor, and
lucrative offices should go to them; if any of the wealthy classes insult
them, the offender should be punished more severely than if he had
wronged one of his own class. Provision should be made that estates
pass by inheritance and not by gift, and no person should have more
than one inheritance; for in this way properties will be equalized, and
more of the poor rise to competency. It is also expedient both in a democracy and in an oligarchy to assign to those who have less share in
the government (i.e., to the rich in a democracy and to the poor in an
oligarchy) an equality or preference in all but the principal offices of
state. The latter should be entrusted chiefly or only to members of the
Politics/125
governing class.
Part IX
There are three qualifications required in those who have to fill the highest offices—(1) first of all, loyalty to the established constitution; (2)
the greatest administrative capacity; (3) virtue and justice of the kind
proper to each form of government; for, if what is just is not the same in
all governments, the quality of justice must also differ. There may be a
doubt, however, when all these qualities do not meet in the same person,
how the selection is to be made; suppose, for example, a good general is
a bad man and not a friend to the constitution, and another man is loyal
and just, which should we choose? In making the election ought we not
to consider two points? what qualities are common, and what are rare.
Thus in the choice of a general, we should regard his skill rather than his
virtue; for few have military skill, but many have virtue. In any office of
trust or stewardship, on the other hand, the opposite rule should be observed; for more virtue than ordinary is required in the holder of such an
office, but the necessary knowledge is of a sort which all men possess.
It may, however, be asked what a man wants with virtue if he have
political ability and is loyal, since these two qualities alone will make
him do what is for the public interest. But may not men have both of
them and yet be deficient in self-control? If, knowing and loving their
own interests, they do not always attend to them, may they not be equally
negligent of the interests of the public?
Speaking generally, we may say that whatever legal enactments are
held to be for the interest of various constitutions, all these preserve
them. And the great preserving principle is the one which has been repeatedly mentioned—to have a care that the loyal citizen should be stronger than the disloyal. Neither should we forget the mean, which at the
present day is lost sight of in perverted forms of government; for many
practices which appear to be democratical are the ruin of democracies,
and many which appear to be oligarchical are the ruin of oligarchies.
Those who think that all virtue is to be found in their own party principles push matters to extremes; they do not consider that disproportion
destroys a state. A nose which varies from the ideal of straightness to a
hook or snub may still be of good shape and agreeable to the eye; but if
the excess be very great, all symmetry is lost, and the nose at last ceases
to be a nose at all on account of some excess in one direction or defect in
the other; and this is true of every other part of the human body. The
126/Aristotle
same law of proportion equally holds in states. Oligarchy or democracy,
although a departure from the most perfect form, may yet be a good
enough government, but if any one attempts to push the principles of
either to an extreme, he will begin by spoiling the government and end
by having none at all. Wherefore the legislator and the statesman ought
to know what democratical measures save and what destroy a democracy, and what oligarchical measures save or destroy an oligarchy. For
neither the one nor the other can exist or continue to exist unless both
rich and poor are included in it. If equality of property is introduced, the
state must of necessity take another form; for when by laws carried to
excess one or other element in the state is ruined, the constitution is
ruined.
There is an error common both to oligarchies and to democracies:
in the latter the demagogues, when the multitude are above the law, are
always cutting the city in two by quarrels with the rich, whereas they
should always profess to be maintaining their cause; just as in oligarchies the oligarchs should profess to maintaining the cause of the people,
and should take oaths the opposite of those which they now take. For
there are cities in which they swear—‘I will be an enemy to the people,
and will devise all the harm against them which I can’; but they ought to
exhibit and to entertain the very opposite feeling; in the form of their
oath there should be an express declaration—‘I will do no wrong to the
people.’
But of all the things which I have mentioned that which most contributes to the permanence of constitutions is the adaptation of education to the form of government, and yet in our own day this principle is
universally neglected. The best laws, though sanctioned by every citizen
of the state, will be of no avail unless the young are trained by habit and
education in the spirit of the constitution, if the laws are democratical,
democratically or oligarchically, if the laws are oligarchical. For there
may be a want of self-discipline in states as well as in individuals. Now,
to have been educated in the spirit of the constitution is not to perform
the actions in which oligarchs or democrats delight, but those by which
the existence of an oligarchy or of a democracy is made possible. Whereas
among ourselves the sons of the ruling class in an oligarchy live in
luxury, but the sons of the poor are hardened by exercise and toil, and
hence they are both more inclined and better able to make a revolution.
And in democracies of the more extreme type there has arisen a false
idea of freedom which is contradictory to the true interests of the state.
Politics/127
For two principles are characteristic of democracy, the government of
the majority and freedom. Men think that what is just is equal; and that
equality is the supremacy of the popular will; and that freedom means
the doing what a man likes. In such democracies every one lives as he
pleases, or in the words of Euripides, ‘according to his fancy.’ But this
is all wrong; men should not think it slavery to live according to the rule
of the constitution; for it is their salvation.
I have now discussed generally the causes of the revolution and
destruction of states, and the means of their preservation and continuance.
Part X
I have still to speak of monarchy, and the causes of its destruction and
preservation. What I have said already respecting forms of constitutional government applies almost equally to royal and to tyrannical rule.
For royal rule is of the nature of an aristocracy, and a tyranny is a
compound of oligarchy and democracy in their most extreme forms; it is
therefore most injurious to its subjects, being made up of two evil forms
of government, and having the perversions and errors of both. These
two forms of monarchy are contrary in their very origin. The appointment of a king is the resource of the better classes against the people,
and he is elected by them out of their own number, because either he
himself or his family excel in virtue and virtuous actions; whereas a
tyrant is chosen from the people to be their protector against the notables, and in order to prevent them from being injured. History shows
that almost all tyrants have been demagogues who gained the favor of
the people by their accusation of the notables. At any rate this was the
manner in which the tyrannies arose in the days when cities had increased in power. Others which were older originated in the ambition of
kings wanting to overstep the limits of their hereditary power and become despots. Others again grew out of the class which were chosen to
be chief magistrates; for in ancient times the people who elected them
gave the magistrates, whether civil or religious, a long tenure. Others
arose out of the custom which oligarchies had of making some individual supreme over the highest offices. In any of these ways an ambitious man had no difficulty, if he desired, in creating a tyranny, since he
had the power in his hands already, either as king or as one of the officers of state. Thus Pheidon at Argos and several others were originally
kings, and ended by becoming tyrants; Phalaris, on the other hand, and
128/Aristotle
the Ionian tyrants, acquired the tyranny by holding great offices. Whereas
Panaetius at Leontini, Cypselus at Corinth, Peisistratus at Athens,
Dionysius at Syracuse, and several others who afterwards became tyrants, were at first demagogues.
And so, as I was saying, royalty ranks with aristocracy, for it is
based upon merit, whether of the individual or of his family, or on benefits conferred, or on these claims with power added to them. For all
who have obtained this honor have benefited, or had in their power to
benefit, states and nations; some, like Codrus, have prevented the state
from being enslaved in war; others, like Cyrus, have given their country
freedom, or have settled or gained a territory, like the Lacedaemonian,
Macedonian, and Molossian kings. The idea of a king is to be a protector of the rich against unjust treatment, of the people against insult and
oppression. Whereas a tyrant, as has often been repeated, has no regard
to any public interest, except as conducive to his private ends; his aim is
pleasure, the aim of a king, honor. Wherefore also in their desires they
differ; the tyrant is desirous of riches, the king, of what brings honor.
And the guards of a king are citizens, but of a tyrant mercenaries.
That tyranny has all the vices both of democracy and oligarchy is
evident. As of oligarchy so of tyranny, the end is wealth; (for by wealth
only can the tyrant maintain either his guard or his luxury). Both mistrust the people, and therefore deprive them of their arms. Both agree
too in injuring the people and driving them out of the city and dispersing
them. From democracy tyrants have borrowed the art of making war
upon the notables and destroying them secretly or openly, or of exiling
them because they are rivals and stand in the way of their power; and
also because plots against them are contrived by men of this dass, who
either want to rule or to escape subjection. Hence Periander advised
Thrasybulus by cutting off the tops of the tallest ears of corn, meaning
that he must always put out of the way the citizens who overtop the rest.
And so, as I have already intimated, the beginnings of change are the
same in monarchies as in forms of constitutional government; subjects
attack their sovereigns out of fear or contempt, or because they have
been unjustly treated by them. And of injustice, the most common form
is insult, another is confiscation of property.
The ends sought by conspiracies against monarchies, whether tyrannies or royalties, are the same as the ends sought by conspiracies
against other forms of government. Monarchs have great wealth and
honor, which are objects of desire to all mankind. The attacks are made
Politics/129
sometimes against their lives, sometimes against the office; where the
sense of insult is the motive, against their lives. Any sort of insult (and
there are many) may stir up anger, and when men are angry, they commonly act out of revenge, and not from ambition. For example, the attempt made upon the Peisistratidae arose out of the public dishonor
offered to the sister of Harmodius and the insult to himself. He attacked
the tyrant for his sister’s sake, and Aristogeiton joined in the attack for
the sake of Harmodius. A conspiracy was also formed against Periander,
the tyrant of Ambracia, because, when drinking with a favorite youth,
he asked him whether by this time he was not with child by him. Philip,
too, was attacked by Pausanias because he permitted him to be insulted
by Attalus and his friends, and Amyntas the little, by Derdas, because
he boasted of having enjoyed his youth. Evagoras of Cyprus, again, was
slain by the eunuch to revenge an insult; for his wife had been carried
off by Evagoras’s son. Many conspiracies have originated in shameful
attempts made by sovereigns on the persons of their subjects. Such was
the attack of Crataeas upon Archelaus; he had always hated the connection with him, and so, when Archelaus, having promised him one of his
two daughters in marriage, did not give him either of them, but broke his
word and married the elder to the king of Elymeia, when he was hard
pressed in a war against Sirrhas and Arrhabaeus, and the younger to his
own son Amyntas, under the idea that Amyntas would then be less likely
to quarrel with his son by Cleopatra—Crataeas made this slight a pretext for attacking Archelaus, though even a less reason would have sufficed, for the real cause of the estrangement was the disgust which he
felt at his connection with the king. And from a like motive Hellonocrates
of Larissa conspired with him; for when Archelaus, who was his lover,
did not fulfill his promise of restoring him to his country, he thought that
the connection between them had originated, not in affection, but in the
wantonness of power. Pytho, too, and Heracleides of Aenos, slew Cotys
in order to avenge their father, and Adamas revolted from Cotys in revenge for the wanton outrage which he had committed in mutilating him
when a child.
Many, too, irritated at blows inflicted on the person which they
deemed an insult, have either killed or attempted to kill officers of state
and royal princes by whom they have been injured. Thus, at Mytilene,
Megacles and his friends attacked and slew the Penthilidae, as they were
going about and striking people with clubs. At a later date Smerdis, who
had been beaten and torn away from his wife by Penthilus, slew him. In
130/Aristotle
the conspiracy against Archelaus, Decamnichus stimulated the fury of
the assassins and led the attack; he was enraged because Archelaus had
delivered him to Euripides to be scourged; for the poet had been irritated
at some remark made by Decamnichus on the foulness of his breath.
Many other examples might be cited of murders and conspiracies which
have arisen from similar causes.
Fear is another motive which, as we have said, has caused conspiracies as well in monarchies as in more popular forms of government. Thus Artapanes conspired against Xerxes and slew him, fearing
that he would be accused of hanging Darius against his orders-he having been under the impression that Xerxes would forget what he had
said in the middle of a meal, and that the offense would be forgiven.
Another motive is contempt, as in the case of Sardanapalus, whom
some one saw carding wool with his women, if the storytellers say truly;
and the tale may be true, if not of him, of some one else. Dion attacked
the younger Dionysius because he despised him, and saw that he was
equally despised by his own subjects, and that he was always drunk.
Even the friends of a tyrant will sometimes attack him out of contempt;
for the confidence which he reposes in them breeds contempt, and they
think that they will not be found out. The expectation of success is likewise a sort of contempt; the assailants are ready to strike, and think
nothing of the danger, because they seem to have the power in their
hands. Thus generals of armies attack monarchs; as, for example, Cyrus
attacked Astyages, despising the effeminacy of his life, and believing
that his power was worn out. Thus again, Seuthes the Thracian conspired against Amadocus, whose general he was.
And sometimes men are actuated by more than one motive, like
Mithridates, who conspired against Ariobarzanes, partly out of contempt and partly from the love of gain.
Bold natures, placed by their sovereigns in a high military position,
are most likely to make the attempt in the expectation of success; for
courage is emboldened by power, and the union of the two inspires them
with the hope of an easy victory.
Attempts of which the motive is ambition arise in a different way as
well as in those already mentioned. There are men who will not risk
their lives in the hope of gains and honors however great, but who nevertheless regard the killing of a tyrant simply as an extraordinary action
which will make them famous and honorable in the world; they wish to
acquire, not a kingdom, but a name. It is rare, however, to find such
Politics/131
men; he who would kill a tyrant must be prepared to lose his life if he
fail. He must have the resolution of Dion, who, when he made war upon
Dionysius, took with him very few troops, saying ‘that whatever measure of success he might attain would be enough for him, even if he were
to die the moment he landed; such a death would be welcome to him.’
this is a temper to which few can attain.
Once more, tyrannies, like all other governments, are destroyed from
without by some opposite and more powerful form of government. That
such a government will have the will to attack them is clear; for the two
are opposed in principle; and all men, if they can, do what they will.
Democracy is antagonistic to tyranny, on the principle of Hesiod, ‘Potter hates Potter,’ because they are nearly akin, for the extreme form of
democracy is tyranny; and royalty and aristocracy are both alike opposed to tyranny, because they are constitutions of a different type. And
therefore the Lacedaemonians put down most of the tyrannies, and so
did the Syracusans during the time when they were well governed.
Again, tyrannies are destroyed from within, when the reigning family are divided among themselves, as that of Gelo was, and more recently that of Dionysius; in the case of Gelo because Thrasybulus, the
brother of Hiero, flattered the son of Gelo and led him into excesses in
order that he might rule in his name. Whereupon the family got together
a party to get rid of Thrasybulus and save the tyranny; but those of the
people who conspired with them seized the opportunity and drove them
all out. In the case of Dionysius, Dion, his own relative, attacked and
expelled him with the assistance of the people; he afterwards perished
himself.
There are two chief motives which induce men to attack tyrannies—
hatred and contempt. Hatred of tyrants is inevitable, and contempt is
also a frequent cause of their destruction. Thus we see that most of
those who have acquired, have retained their power, but those who have
inherited, have lost it, almost at once; for, living in luxurious ease, they
have become contemptible, and offer many opportunities to their assailants. Anger, too, must be included under hatred, and produces the same
effects. It is often times even more ready to strike—the angry are more
impetuous in making an attack, for they do not follow rational principle.
And men are very apt to give way to their passions when they are insulted. To this cause is to be attributed the fall of the Peisistratidae and
of many others. Hatred is more reasonable, for anger is accompanied by
pain, which is an impediment to reason, whereas hatred is painless.
132/Aristotle
In a word, all the causes which I have mentioned as destroying the
last and most unmixed form of oligarchy, and the extreme form of democracy, may be assumed to affect tyranny; indeed the extreme forms
of both are only tyrannies distributed among several persons. Kingly
rule is little affected by external causes, and is therefore lasting; it is
generally destroyed from within. And there are two ways in which the
destruction may come about; (1) when the members of the royal family
quarrel among themselves, and (2) when the kings attempt to administer
the state too much after the fashion of a tyranny, and to extend their
authority contrary to the law. Royalties do not now come into existence;
where such forms of government arise, they are rather monarchies or
tyrannies. For the rule of a king is over voluntary subjects, and he is
supreme in all important matters; but in our own day men are more
upon an equality, and no one is so immeasurably superior to others as to
represent adequately the greatness and dignity of the office. Hence mankind will not, if they can help, endure it, and any one who obtains power
by force or fraud is at once thought to be a tyrant. In hereditary monarchies a further cause of destruction is the fact that kings often fall into
contempt, and, although possessing not tyrannical power, but only royal
dignity, are apt to outrage others. Their overthrow is then readily effected; for there is an end to the king when his subjects do not want to
have him, but the tyrant lasts, whether they like him or not.
The destruction of monarchies is to be attributed to these and the
like causes.
Part XI
And they are preserved, to speak generally, by the opposite causes; or, if
we consider them separately, (1) royalty is preserved by the limitation
of its powers. The more restricted the functions of kings, the longer their
power will last unimpaired; for then they are more moderate and not so
despotic in their ways; and they are less envied by their subjects. This is
the reason why the kingly office has lasted so long among the Molossians.
And for a similar reason it has continued among the Lacedaemonians,
because there it was always divided between two, and afterwards further limited by Theopompus in various respects, more particularly by
the establishment of the Ephoralty. He diminished the power of the kings,
but established on a more lasting basis the kingly office, which was thus
made in a certain sense not less, but greater. There is a story that when
his wife once asked him whether he was not ashamed to leave to his sons
Politics/133
a royal power which was less than he had inherited from his father, ‘No
indeed,’ he replied, ‘for the power which I leave to them will be more
lasting.’
As to (2) tyrannies, they are preserved in two most opposite ways.
One of them is the old traditional method in which most tyrants administer their government. Of such arts Periander of Corinth is said to have
been the great master, and many similar devices may be gathered from
the Persians in the administration of their government. There are firstly
the prescriptions mentioned some distance back, for the preservation of
a tyranny, in so far as this is possible; viz., that the tyrant should lop off
those who are too high; he must put to death men of spirit; he must not
allow common meals, clubs, education, and the like; he must be upon
his guard against anything which is likely to inspire either courage or
confidence among his subjects; he must prohibit literary assemblies or
other meetings for discussion, and he must take every means to prevent
people from knowing one another (for acquaintance begets mutual confidence). Further, he must compel all persons staying in the city to appear in public and live at his gates; then he will know what they are
doing: if they are always kept under, they will learn to be humble. In
short, he should practice these and the like Persian and barbaric arts,
which all have the same object. A tyrant should also endeavor to know
what each of his subjects says or does, and should employ spies, like the
‘female detectives’ at Syracuse, and the eavesdroppers whom Hiero was
in the habit of sending to any place of resort or meeting; for the fear of
informers prevents people from speaking their minds, and if they do,
they are more easily found out. Another art of the tyrant is to sow quarrels among the citizens; friends should be embroiled with friends, the
people with the notables, and the rich with one another. Also he should
impoverish his subjects; he thus provides against the maintenance of a
guard by the citizen and the people, having to keep hard at work, are
prevented from conspiring. The Pyramids of Egypt afford an example
of this policy; also the offerings of the family of Cypselus, and the building
of the temple of Olympian Zeus by the Peisistratidae, and the great
Polycratean monuments at Samos; all these works were alike intended
to occupy the people and keep them poor. Another practice of tyrants is
to multiply taxes, after the manner of Dionysius at Syracuse, who contrived that within five years his subjects should bring into the treasury
their whole property. The tyrant is also fond of making war in order that
his subjects may have something to do and be always in want of a leader.
134/Aristotle
And whereas the power of a king is preserved by his friends, the characteristic of a tyrant is to distrust his friends, because he knows that all
men want to overthrow him, and they above all have the power.
Again, the evil practices of the last and worst form of democracy
are all found in tyrannies. Such are the power given to women in their
families in the hope that they will inform against their husbands, and the
license which is allowed to slaves in order that they may betray their
masters; for slaves and women do not conspire against tyrants; and they
are of course friendly to tyrannies and also to democracies, since under
them they have a good time. For the people too would fain be a monarch, and therefore by them, as well as by the tyrant, the flatterer is held
in honor; in democracies he is the demagogue; and the tyrant also has
those who associate with him in a humble spirit, which is a work of
flattery.
Hence tyrants are always fond of bad men, because they love to be
flattered, but no man who has the spirit of a freeman in him will lower
himself by flattery; good men love others, or at any rate do not flatter
them. Moreover, the bad are useful for bad purposes; ‘nail knocks out
nail,’ as the proverb says. It is characteristic of a tyrant to dislike every
one who has dignity or independence; he wants to be alone in his glory,
but any one who claims a like dignity or asserts his independence encroaches upon his prerogative, and is hated by him as an enemy to his
power. Another mark of a tyrant is that he likes foreigners better than
citizens, and lives with them and invites them to his table; for the one are
enemies, but the Others enter into no rivalry with him.
Such are the notes of the tyrant and the arts by which he preserves
his power; there is no wickedness too great for him. All that we have
said may be summed up under three heads, which answer to the three
aims of the tyrant. These are, (1) the humiliation of his subjects; he
knows that a mean-spirited man will not conspire against anybody; (2)
the creation of mistrust among them; for a tyrant is not overthrown until
men begin to have confidence in one another; and this is the reason why
tyrants are at war with the good; they are under the idea that their power
is endangered by them, not only because they would not be ruled despotically but also because they are loyal to one another, and to other
men, and do not inform against one another or against other men; (3) the
tyrant desires that his subjects shall be incapable of action, for no one
attempts what is impossible, and they will not attempt to overthrow a
tyranny, if they are powerless. Under these three heads the whole policy
Politics/135
of a tyrant may be summed up, and to one or other of them all his ideas
may be referred: (1) he sows distrust among his subjects; (2) he takes
away their power; (3) he humbles them.
This then is one of the two methods by which tyrannies are preserved; and there is another which proceeds upon an almost opposite
principle of action. The nature of this latter method may be gathered
from a comparison of the causes which destroy kingdoms, for as one
mode of destroying kingly power is to make the office of king more
tyrannical, so the salvation of a tyranny is to make it more like the rule
of a king. But of one thing the tyrant must be careful; he must keep
power enough to rule over his subjects, whether they like him or not, for
if he once gives this up he gives up his tyranny. But though power must
be retained as the foundation, in all else the tyrant should act or appear
to act in the character of a king. In the first place he should pretend a
care of the public revenues, and not waste money in making presents of
a sort at which the common people get excited when they see their hardwon earnings snatched from them and lavished on courtesans and strangers and artists. He should give an account of what he receives and of
what he spends (a practice which has been adopted by some tyrants);
for then he will seem to be a steward of the public rather than a tyrant;
nor need he fear that, while he is the lord of the city, he will ever be in
want of money. Such a policy is at all events much more advantageous
for the tyrant when he goes from home, than to leave behind him a
hoard, for then the garrison who remain in the city will be less likely to
attack his power; and a tyrant, when he is absent from home, has more
reason to fear the guardians of his treasure than the citizens, for the one
accompany him, but the others remain behind. In the second place, he
should be seen to collect taxes and to require public services only for
state purposes, and that he may form a fund in case of war, and generally he ought to make himself the guardian and treasurer of them, as if
they belonged, not to him, but to the public. He should appear, not harsh,
but dignified, and when men meet him they should look upon him with
reverence, and not with fear. Yet it is hard for him to be respected if he
inspires no respect, and therefore whatever virtues he may neglect, at
least he should maintain the character of a great soldier, and produce the
impression that he is one. Neither he nor any of his associates should
ever be guilty of the least offense against modesty towards the young of
either sex who are his subjects, and the women of his family should
observe a like self-control towards other women; the insolence of women
136/Aristotle
has ruined many tyrannies. In the indulgence of pleasures he should be
the opposite of our modern tyrants, who not only begin at dawn and
pass whole days in sensuality, but want other men to see them, that they
may admire their happy and blessed lot. In these things a tyrant should
if possible be moderate, or at any rate should not parade his vices to the
world; for a drunken and drowsy tyrant is soon despised and attacked;
not so he who is temperate and wide awake. His conduct should be the
very reverse of nearly everything which has been said before about tyrants. He ought to adorn and improve his city, as though he were not a
tyrant, but the guardian of the state. Also he should appear to be particularly earnest in the service of the Gods; for if men think that a ruler
is religious and has a reverence for the Gods, they are less afraid of
suffering injustice at his hands, and they are less disposed to conspire
against him, because they believe him to have the very Gods fighting on
his side. At the same time his religion must not be thought foolish. And
he should honor men of merit, and make them think that they would not
be held in more honor by the citizens if they had a free government. The
honor he should distribute himself, but the punishment should be inflicted by officers and courts of law. It is a precaution which is taken by
all monarchs not to make one person great; but if one, then two or more
should be raised, that they may look sharply after one another. If after
all some one has to be made great, he should not be a man of bold spirit;
for such dispositions are ever most inclined to strike. And if any one is
to be deprived of his power, let it be diminished gradually, not taken
from him all at once. The tyrant should abstain from all outrage; in
particular from personal violence and from wanton conduct towards the
young. He should be especially careful of his behavior to men who are
lovers of honor; for as the lovers of money are offended when their
property is touched, so are the lovers of honor and the virtuous when
their honor is affected. Therefore a tyrant ought either not to commit
such acts at all; or he should be thought only to employ fatherly correction, and not to trample upon others—and his acquaintance with youth
should be supposed to arise from affection, and not from the insolence
of power, and in general he should compensate the appearance of dishonor by the increase of honor.
Of those who attempt assassination they are the most dangerous,
and require to be most carefully watched, who do not care to survive, if
they effect their purpose. Therefore special precaution should be taken
about any who think that either they or those for whom they care have
Politics/137
been insulted; for when men are led away by passion to assault others
they are regardless of themselves. As Heracleitus says, ‘It is difficult to
fight against anger; for a man will buy revenge with his soul.’
And whereas states consist of two classes, of poor men and of rich,
the tyrant should lead both to imagine that they are preserved and prevented from harming one another by his rule, and whichever of the two
is stronger he should attach to his government; for, having this advantage, he has no need either to emancipate slaves or to disarm the citizens; either party added to the force which he already has, will make
him stronger than his assailants.
But enough of these details; what should be the general policy of the
tyrant is obvious. He ought to show himself to his subjects in the light,
not of a tyrant, but of a steward and a king. He should not appropriate
what is theirs, but should be their guardian; he should be moderate, not
extravagant in his way of life; he should win the notables by companionship, and the multitude by flattery. For then his rule will of necessity
be nobler and happier, because he will rule over better men whose spirits are not crushed, over men to whom he himself is not an object of
hatred, and of whom he is not afraid. His power too will be more lasting. His disposition will be virtuous, or at least half virtuous; and he
will not be wicked, but half wicked only.
Part XII
Yet no forms of government are so short-lived as oligarchy and tyranny.
The tyranny which lasted longest was that of Orthagoras and his sons at
Sicyon; this continued for a hundred years. The reason was that they
treated their subjects with moderation, and to a great extent observed
the laws; and in various ways gained the favor of the people by the care
which they took of them. Cleisthenes, in particular, was respected for
his military ability. If report may be believed, he crowned the judge who
decided against him in the games; and, as some say, the sitting statue in
the Agora of Sicyon is the likeness of this person. (A similar story is
told of Peisistratus, who is said on one occasion to have allowed himself
to be summoned and tried before the Areopagus.)
Next in duration to the tyranny of Orthagoras was that of the
Cypselidae at Corinth, which lasted seventy-three years and six months:
Cypselus reigned thirty years, Periander forty and a half, and
Psammetichus the son of Gorgus three. Their continuance was due to
similar causes: Cypselus was a popular man, who during the whole time
138/Aristotle
of his rule never had a bodyguard; and Periander, although he was a
tyrant, was a great soldier. Third in duration was the rule of the
Peisistratidae at Athens, but it was interrupted; for Peisistratus was
twice driven out, so that during three and thirty years he reigned only
seventeen; and his sons reigned eighteen-altogether thirty-five years. Of
other tyrannies, that of Hiero and Gelo at Syracuse was the most lasting. Even this, however, was short, not more than eighteen years in all;
for Gelo continued tyrant for seven years, and died in the eighth; Hiero
reigned for ten years, and Thrasybulus was driven out in the eleventh
month. In fact, tyrannies generally have been of quite short duration.
I have now gone through almost all the causes by which constitutional governments and monarchies are either destroyed or preserved.
In the Republic of Plato, Socrates treats of revolutions, but not well,
for he mentions no cause of change which peculiarly affects the first, or
perfect state. He only says that the cause is that nothing is abiding, but
all things change in a certain cycle; and that the origin of the change
consists in those numbers ‘of which 4 and 3, married with 5, furnish
two harmonies’ (he means when the number of this figure becomes solid);
he conceives that nature at certain times produces bad men who will not
submit to education; in which latter particular he may very likely be not
far wrong, for there may well be some men who cannot be educated and
made virtuous. But why is such a cause of change peculiar to his ideal
state, and not rather common to all states, nay, to everything which
comes into being at all? And is it by the agency of time, which, as he
declares, makes all things change, that things which did not begin together, change together? For example, if something has come into being
the day before the completion of the cycle, will it change with things
that came into being before? Further, why should the perfect state change
into the Spartan? For governments more often take an opposite form
than one akin to them. The same remark is applicable to the other changes;
he says that the Spartan constitution changes into an oligarchy, and this
into a democracy, and this again into a tyranny. And yet the contrary
happens quite as often; for a democracy is even more likely to change
into an oligarchy than into a monarchy. Further, he never says whether
tyranny is, or is not, liable to revolutions, and if it is, what is the cause
of them, or into what form it changes. And the reason is, that he could
not very well have told: for there is no rule; according to him it should
revert to the first and best, and then there would be a complete cycle.
But in point of fact a tyranny often changes into a tyranny, as that at
Politics/139
Sicyon changed from the tyranny of Myron into that of Cleisthenes; into
oligarchy, as the tyranny of Antileon did at Chalcis; into democracy, as
that of Gelo’s family did at Syracuse; into aristocracy, as at Carthage,
and the tyranny of Charilaus at Lacedaemon. Often an oligarchy changes
into a tyranny, like most of the ancient oligarchies in Sicily; for example, the oligarchy at Leontini changed into the tyranny of Panaetius;
that at Gela into the tyranny of Cleander; that at Rhegium into the tyranny of Anaxilaus; the same thing has happened in many other states.
And it is absurd to suppose that the state changes into oligarchy merely
because the ruling class are lovers and makers of money, and not because the very rich think it unfair that the very poor should have an
equal share in the government with themselves. Moreover, in many oligarchies there are laws against making money in trade. But at Carthage,
which is a democracy. there is no such prohibition; and yet to this day
the Carthaginians have never had a revolution. It is absurd too for him
to say that an oligarchy is two cities, one of the rich, and the other of the
poor. Is not this just as much the case in the Spartan constitution, or in
any other in which either all do not possess equal property, or all are not
equally good men? Nobody need be any poorer than he was before, and
yet the oligarchy may change an the same into a democracy, if the poor
form the majority; and a democracy may change into an oligarchy, if the
wealthy class are stronger than the people, and the one are energetic, the
other indifferent. Once more, although the causes of the change are very
numerous, he mentions only one, which is, that the citizens become poor
through dissipation and debt, as though he thought that all, or the majority of them, were originally rich. This is not true: though it is true that
when any of the leaders lose their property they are ripe for revolution;
but, when anybody else, it is no great matter, and an oligarchy does not
even then more often pass into a democracy than into any other form of
government. Again, if men are deprived of the honors of state, and are
wronged, and insulted, they make revolutions, and change forms of government, even although they have not wasted their substance because
they might do what they liked—of which extravagance he declares excessive freedom to be the cause.
Finally, although there are many forms of oligarchies and democracies, Socrates speaks of their revolutions as though there were only one
form of either of them.
140/Aristotle
BOOK SIX
Part I
We have now considered the varieties of the deliberative or supreme
power in states, and the various arrangements of law-courts and state
offices, and which of them are adapted to different forms of government. We have also spoken of the destruction and preservation of constitutions, how and from what causes they arise.
Of democracy and all other forms of government there are many
kinds; and it will be well to assign to them severally the modes of organization which are proper and advantageous to each, adding what remains to be said about them. Moreover, we ought to consider the various combinations of these modes themselves; for such combinations
make constitutions overlap one another, so that aristocracies have an
oligarchical character, and constitutional governments incline to democracies.
When I speak of the combinations which remain to be considered,
and thus far have not been considered by us, I mean such as these: when
the deliberative part of the government and the election of officers is
constituted oligarchically, and the law-courts aristocratically, or when
the courts and the deliberative part of the state are oligarchical, and the
election to office aristocratical, or when in any other way there is a want
of harmony in the composition of a state.
I have shown already what forms of democracy are suited to particular cities, and what of oligarchy to particular peoples, and to whom
each of the other forms of government is suited. Further, we must not
only show which of these governments is the best for each state, but also
briefly proceed to consider how these and other forms of government
are to be established.
First of all let us speak of democracy, which will also bring to light
the opposite form of government commonly called oligarchy. For the
purposes of this inquiry we need to ascertain all the elements and characteristics of democracy, since from the combinations of these the varieties of democratic government arise. There are several of these differing from each other, and the difference is due to two causes. One (1) has
been already mentioned—differences of population; for the popular element may consist of husbandmen, or of mechanics, or of laborers, and
if the first of these be added to the second, or the third to the two others,
not only does the democracy become better or worse, but its very nature
is changed. A second cause (2) remains to be mentioned: the various
Politics/141
properties and characteristics of democracy, when variously combined,
make a difference. For one democracy will have less and another will
have more, and another will have all of these characteristics. There is an
advantage in knowing them all, whether a man wishes to establish some
new form of democracy, or only to remodel an existing one. Founders of
states try to bring together all the elements which accord with the ideas
of the several constitutions; but this is a mistake of theirs, as I have
already remarked when speaking of the destruction and preservation of
states. We will now set forth the principles, characteristics, and aims of
such states.
Part II
The basis of a democratic state is liberty; which, according to the common opinion of men, can only be enjoyed in such a state; this they affirm
to be the great end of every democracy. One principle of liberty is for all
to rule and be ruled in turn, and indeed democratic justice is the application of numerical not proportionate equality; whence it follows that the
majority must be supreme, and that whatever the majority approve must
be the end and the just. Every citizen, it is said, must have equality, and
therefore in a democracy the poor have more power than the rich, because there are more of them, and the will of the majority is supreme.
This, then, is one note of liberty which all democrats affirm to be the
principle of their state. Another is that a man should live as he likes.
This, they say, is the privilege of a freeman, since, on the other hand, not
to live as a man likes is the mark of a slave. This is the second characteristic of democracy, whence has arisen the claim of men to be ruled by
none, if possible, or, if this is impossible, to rule and be ruled in turns;
and so it contributes to the freedom based upon equality.
Such being our foundation and such the principle from which we
start, the characteristics of democracy are as follows the election of
officers by all out of all; and that all should rule over each, and each in
his turn over all; that the appointment to all offices, or to all but those
which require experience and skill, should be made by lot; that no property qualification should be required for offices, or only a very low one;
that a man should not hold the same office twice, or not often, or in the
case of few except military offices: that the tenure of all offices, or of as
many as possible, should be brief, that all men should sit in judgment, or
that judges selected out of all should judge, in all matters, or in most and
in the greatest and most important—such as the scrutiny of accounts,
142/Aristotle
the constitution, and private contracts; that the assembly should be supreme over all causes, or at any rate over the most important, and the
magistrates over none or only over a very few. Of all magistracies, a
council is the most democratic when there is not the means of paying all
the citizens, but when they are paid even this is robbed of its power; for
the people then draw all cases to themselves, as I said in the previous
discussion. The next characteristic of democracy is payment for services; assembly, law courts, magistrates, everybody receives pay, when
it is to be had; or when it is not to be had for all, then it is given to the
law-courts and to the stated assemblies, to the council and to the magistrates, or at least to any of them who are compelled to have their meals
together. And whereas oligarchy is characterized by birth, wealth, and
education, the notes of democracy appear to be the opposite of these—
low birth, poverty, mean employment. Another note is that no magistracy is perpetual, but if any such have survived some ancient change in
the constitution it should be stripped of its power, and the holders should
be elected by lot and no longer by vote. These are the points common to
all democracies; but democracy and demos in their truest form are based
upon the recognized principle of democratic justice, that all should count
equally; for equality implies that the poor should have no more share in
the government than the rich, and should not be the only rulers, but that
all should rule equally according to their numbers. And in this way men
think that they will secure equality and freedom in their state.
Part III
Next comes the question, how is this equality to be obtained? Are we to
assign to a thousand poor men the property qualifications of five hundred rich men? and shall we give the thousand a power equal to that of
the five hundred? or, if this is not to be the mode, ought we, still retaining the same ratio, to take equal numbers from each and give them the
control of the elections and of the courts?—Which, according to the
democratical notion, is the juster form of the constitution—this or one
based on numbers only? Democrats say that justice is that to which the
majority agree, oligarchs that to which the wealthier class; in their opinion the decision should be given according to the amount of property. In
both principles there is some inequality and injustice. For if justice is
the will of the few, any one person who has more wealth than all the rest
of the rich put together, ought, upon the oligarchical principle, to have
the sole power—but this would be tyranny; or if justice is the will of the
Politics/143
majority, as I was before saying, they will unjustly confiscate the property of the wealthy minority. To find a principle of equality which they
both agree we must inquire into their respective ideas of justice.
Now they agree in saying that whatever is decided by the majority
of the citizens is to be deemed law. Granted: but not without some reserve; since there are two classes out of which a state is composed—the
poor and the rich—that is to be deemed law, on which both or the greater
part of both agree; and if they disagree, that which is approved by the
greater number, and by those who have the higher qualification. For
example, suppose that there are ten rich and twenty poor, and some
measure is approved by six of the rich and is disapproved by fifteen of
the poor, and the remaining four of the rich join with the party of the
poor, and the remaining five of the poor with that of the rich; in such a
case the will of those whose qualifications, when both sides are added
up, are the greatest, should prevail. If they turn out to be equal, there is
no greater difficulty than at present, when, if the assembly or the courts
are divided, recourse is had to the lot, or to some similar expedient. But,
although it may be difficult in theory to know what is just and equal, the
practical difficulty of inducing those to forbear who can, if they like,
encroach, is far greater, for the weaker are always asking for equality
and justice, but the stronger care for none of these things.
Part IV
Of the four kinds of democracy, as was said in the in the previous discussion, the best is that which comes first in order; it is also the oldest of
them all. I am speaking of them according to the natural classification
of their inhabitants. For the best material of democracy is an agricultural population; there is no difficulty in forming a democracy where the
mass of the people live by agriculture or tending of cattle. Being poor,
they have no leisure, and therefore do not often attend the assembly, and
not having the necessaries of life they are always at work, and do not
covet the property of others. Indeed, they find their employment pleasanter
than the cares of government or office where no great gains can be made
out of them, for the many are more desirous of gain than of honor. A
proof is that even the ancient tyrannies were patiently endured by them,
as they still endure oligarchies, if they are allowed to work and are not
deprived of their property; for some of them grow quickly rich and the
others are well enough off. Moreover, they have the power of electing
the magistrates and calling them to account; their ambition, if they have
144/Aristotle
any, is thus satisfied; and in some democracies, although they do not all
share in the appointment of offices, except through representatives elected
in turn out of the whole people, as at Mantinea; yet, if they have the
power of deliberating, the many are contented. Even this form of government may be regarded as a democracy, and was such at Mantinea.
Hence it is both expedient and customary in the aforementioned type of
democracy that all should elect to offices, and conduct scrutinies, and
sit in the law-courts, but that the great offices should be filled up by
election and from persons having a qualification; the greater requiring a
greater qualification, or, if there be no offices for which a qualification
is required, then those who are marked out by special ability should be
appointed. Under such a form of government the citizens are sure to be
governed well (for the offices will always be held by the best persons;
the people are willing enough to elect them and are not jealous of the
good). The good and the notables will then be satisfied, for they will not
be governed by men who are their inferiors, and the persons elected will
rule justly, because others will call them to account. Every man should
be responsible to others, nor should any one be allowed to do just as he
pleases; for where absolute freedom is allowed, there is nothing to restrain the evil which is inherent in every man. But the principle of responsibility secures that which is the greatest good in states; the right
persons rule and are prevented from doing wrong, and the people have
their due. It is evident that this is the best kind of democracy, and why?
Because the people are drawn from a certain class. Some of the ancient
laws of most states were, all of them, useful with a view to making the
people husbandmen. They provided either that no one should possess
more than a certain quantity of land, or that, if he did, the land should
not be within a certain distance from the town or the acropolis. Formerly in many states there was a law forbidding any one to sell his
original allotment of land. There is a similar law attributed to Oxylus,
which is to the effect that there should be a certain portion of every
man’s land on which he could not borrow money. A useful corrective to
the evil of which I am speaking would be the law of the Aphytaeans,
who, although they are numerous, and do not possess much land, are all
of them husbandmen. For their properties are reckoned in the census;
not entire, but only in such small portions that even the poor may have
more than the amount required.
Next best to an agricultural, and in many respects similar, are a
pastoral people, who live by their flocks; they are the best trained of any
Politics/145
for war, robust in body and able to camp out. The people of whom other
democracies consist are far inferior to them, for their life is inferior;
there is no room for moral excellence in any of their employments,
whether they be mechanics or traders or laborers. Besides, people of
this class can readily come to the assembly, because they are continually moving about in the city and in the agora; whereas husbandmen are
scattered over the country and do not meet, or equally feel the want of
assembling together. Where the territory also happens to extend to a
distance from the city, there is no difficulty in making an excellent democracy or constitutional government; for the people are compelled to
settle in the country, and even if there is a town population the assembly
ought not to meet, in democracies, when the country people cannot come.
We have thus explained how the first and best form of democracy should
be constituted; it is clear that the other or inferior sorts will deviate in a
regular order, and the population which is excluded will at each stage be
of a lower kind.
The last form of democracy, that in which all share alike, is one
which cannot be borne by all states, and will not last long unless well
regulated by laws and customs. The more general causes which tend to
destroy this or other kinds of government have been pretty fully considered. In order to constitute such a democracy and strengthen the people,
the leaders have been in the habit including as many as they can, and
making citizens not only of those who are legitimate, but even of the
illegitimate, and of those who have only one parent a citizen, whether
father or mother; for nothing of this sort comes amiss to such a democracy. This is the way in which demagogues proceed. Whereas the right
thing would be to make no more additions when the number of the commonalty exceeds that of the notables and of the middle class—beyond
this not to go. When in excess of this point, the constitution becomes
disorderly, and the notables grow excited and impatient of the democracy, as in the insurrection at Cyrene; for no notice is taken of a little
evil, but when it increases it strikes the eye. Measures like those which
Cleisthenes passed when he wanted to increase the power of the democracy at Athens, or such as were taken by the founders of popular government at Cyrene, are useful in the extreme form of democracy. Fresh
tribes and brotherhoods should be established; the private rites of families should be restricted and converted into public ones; in short, every
contrivance should be adopted which will mingle the citizens with one
another and get rid of old connections. Again, the measures which are
146/Aristotle
taken by tyrants appear all of them to be democratic; such, for instance,
as the license permitted to slaves (which may be to a certain extent
advantageous) and also that of women and children, and the aflowing
everybody to live as he likes. Such a government will have many supporters, for most persons would rather live in a disorderly than in a
sober manner.
Part V
The mere establishment of a democracy is not the only or principal
business of the legislator, or of those who wish to create such a state, for
any state, however badly constituted, may last one, two, or three days; a
far greater difficulty is the preservation of it. The legislator should therefore endeavor to have a firm foundation according to the principles already laid down concerning the preservation and destruction of states;
he should guard against the destructive elements, and should make laws,
whether written or unwritten, which will contain all the preservatives of
states. He must not think the truly democratical or oligarchical measure
to be that which will give the greatest amount of democracy or oligarchy, but that which will make them last longest. The demagogues of our
own day often get property confiscated in the law-courts in order to
please the people. But those who have the welfare of the state at heart
should counteract them, and make a law that the property of the condemned should not be public and go into the treasury but be sacred.
Thus offenders will be as much afraid, for they will be punished all the
same, and the people, having nothing to gain, will not be so ready to
condemn the accused. Care should also be taken that state trials are as
few as possible, and heavy penalties should be inflicted on those who
bring groundless accusations; for it is the practice to indict, not members of the popular party, but the notables, although the citizens ought
to be all attached to the constitution as well, or at any rate should not
regard their rulers as enemies.
Now, since in the last and worst form of democracy the citizens are
very numerous, and can hardly be made to assemble unless they are
paid, and to pay them when there are no revenues presses hardly upon
the notables (for the money must be obtained by a property tax and
confiscations and corrupt practices of the courts, things which have
before now overthrown many democracies); where, I say, there are no
revenues, the government should hold few assemblies, and the law-courts
should consist of many persons, but sit for a few days only. This system
Politics/147
has two advantages: first, the rich do not fear the expense, even although they are unpaid themselves when the poor are paid; and secondly, causes are better tried, for wealthy persons, although they do not
like to be long absent from their own affairs, do not mind going for a
few days to the law-courts. Where there are revenues the demagogues
should not be allowed after their manner to distribute the surplus; the
poor are always receiving and always wanting more and more, for such
help is like water poured into a leaky cask. Yet the true friend of the
people should see that they be not too poor, for extreme poverty lowers
the character of the democracy; measures therefore should be taken which
will give them lasting prosperity; and as this is equally the interest of all
classes, the proceeds of the public revenues should be accumulated and
distributed among its poor, if possible, in such quantities as may enable
them to purchase a little farm, or, at any rate, make a beginning in trade
or husbandry. And if this benevolence cannot be extended to all, money
should be distributed in turn according to tribes or other divisions, and
in the meantime the rich should pay the fee for the attendance of the
poor at the necessary assemblies; and should in return be excused from
useless public services. By administering the state in this spirit the
Carthaginians retain the affections of the people; their policy is from
time to time to send some of them into their dependent towns, where
they grow rich. It is also worthy of a generous and sensible nobility to
divide the poor amongst them, and give them the means of going to
work. The example of the people of Tarentum is also well deserving of
imitation, for, by sharing the use of their own property with the poor,
they gain their good will. Moreover, they divide all their offices into two
classes, some of them being elected by vote, the others by lot; the latter,
that the people may participate in them, and the former, that the state
may be better administered. A like result may be gained by dividing the
same offices, so as to have two classes of magistrates, one chosen by
vote, the other by lot.
Enough has been said of the manner in which democracies ought to
be constituted.
Part VI
From these considerations there will be no difficulty in seeing what should
be the constitution of oligarchies. We have only to reason from opposites and compare each form of oligarchy with the corresponding form
of democracy.
148/Aristotle
The first and best attempered of oligarchies is akin to a constitutional government. In this there ought to be two standards of qualification; the one high, the other low—the lower qualifying for the humbler
yet indispensable offices and the higher for the superior ones. He who
acquires the prescribed qualification should have the rights of citizenship. The number of those admitted should be such as will make the
entire governing body stronger than those who are excluded, and the
new citizen should be always taken out of the better class of the people.
The principle, narrowed a little, gives another form of oligarchy; until
at length we reach the most cliquish and tyrannical of them all, answering to the extreme democracy, which, being the worst, requires vigilance in proportion to its badness. For as healthy bodies and ships well
provided with sailors may undergo many mishaps and survive them,
whereas sickly constitutions and rotten ill-manned ships are ruined by
the very least mistake, so do the worst forms of government require the
greatest care. The populousness of democracies generally preserves them
(for e state need not be much increased,since there is no necessity tha
number is to democracy in the place of justice based on proportion);
whereas the preservation of an oligarchy clearly depends on an opposite
principle, viz., good order.
Part VII
As there are four chief divisions of the common people—husbandmen,
mechanics, retail traders, laborers; so also there are four kinds of military forces—the cavalry, the heavy infantry, the light armed troops, the
navy. When the country is adapted for cavalry, then a strong oligarchy
is likely to be established. For the security of the inhabitants depends
upon a force of this sort, and only rich men can afford to keep horses.
The second form of oligarchy prevails when the country is adapted to
heavy infantry; for this service is better suited to the rich than to the
poor. But the light-armed and the naval element are wholly democratic;
and nowadays, where they are numerous, if the two parties quarrel, the
oligarchy are often worsted by them in the struggle. A remedy for this
state of things may be found in the practice of generals who combine a
proper contingent of light-armed troops with cavalry and heavy-armed.
And this is the way in which the poor get the better of the rich in civil
contests; being lightly armed, they fight with advantage against cavalry
and heavy being lightly armed, they fight with advantage against cavalry and heavy infantry. An oligarchy which raises such a force out of
Politics/149
the lower classes raises a power against itself. And therefore, since the
ages of the citizens vary and some are older and some younger, the
fathers should have their own sons, while they are still young, taught the
agile movements of light-armed troops; and these, when they have been
taken out of the ranks of the youth, should become light-armed warriors
in reality. The oligarchy should also yield a share in the government to
the people, either, as I said before, to those who have a property qualification, or, as in the case of Thebes, to those who have abstained for a
certain number of years from mean employments, or, as at Massalia, to
men of merit who are selected for their worthiness, whether previously
citizens or not. The magistracies of the highest rank, which ought to be
in the hands of the governing body, should have expensive duties attached to them, and then the people will not desire them and will take no
offense at the privileges of their rulers when they see that they pay a
heavy fine for their dignity. It is fitting also that the magistrates on
entering office should offer magnificent sacrifices or erect some public
edifice, and then the people who participate in the entertainments, and
see the city decorated with votive offerings and buildings, will not desire
an alteration in the government, and the notables will have memorials of
their munificence. This, however, is anything but the fashion of our
modern oligarchs, who are as covetous of gain as they are of honor;
oligarchies like theirs may be well described as petty democracies. Enough
of the manner in which democracies and oligarchies should be organized.
Part VIII
Next in order follows the right distribution of offices, their number,
their nature, their duties, of which indeed we have already spoken. No
state can exist not having the necessary offices, and no state can be well
administered not having the offices which tend to preserve harmony and
good order. In small states, as we have already remarked, there must not
be many of them, but in larger there must be a larger number, and we
should carefully consider which offices may properly be united and which
separated.
First among necessary offices is that which has the care of the market; a magistrate should be appointed to inspect contracts and to maintain order. For in every state there must inevitably be buyers and sellers
who will supply one another’s wants; this is the readiest way to make a
state self-sufficing and so fulfill the purpose for which men come to-
150/Aristotle
gether into one state. A second office of a similar kind undertakes the
supervision and embellishment of public and private buildings, the maintaining and repairing of houses and roads, the prevention of disputes
about boundaries, and other concerns of a like nature. This is commonly called the office of City Warden, and has various departments,
which, in more populous towns, are shared among different persons,
one, for example, taking charge of the walls, another of the fountains, a
third of harbors. There is another equally necessary office, and of a
similar kind, having to do with the same matters without the walls and
in the country—the magistrates who hold this office are called Wardens
of the country, or Inspectors of the woods. Besides these three there is a
fourth office of receivers of taxes, who have under their charge the revenue which is distributed among the various departments; these are called
Receivers or Treasurers. Another officer registers all private contracts,
and decisions of the courts, all public indictments, and also all preliminary proceedings. This office again is sometimes subdivided, in which
case one officer is appointed over all the rest. These officers are called
Recorders or Sacred Recorders, Presidents, and the like.
Next to these comes an office of which the duties are the most necessary and also the most difficult, viz., that to which is committed the
execution of punishments, or the exaction of fines from those who are
posted up according to the registers; and also the custody of prisoners.
The difficulty of this office arises out of the odium which is attached to
it; no one will undertake it unless great profits are to be made, and any
one who does is loath to execute the law. Still the office is necessary; for
judicial decisions are useless if they take no effect; and if society cannot
exist without them, neither can it exist without the execution of them. It
is an office which, being so unpopular, should not be entrusted to one
person, but divided among several taken from different courts. In like
manner an effort should be made to distribute among different persons
the writing up of those who are on the register of public debtors. Some
sentences should be executed by the magistrates also, and in particular
penalties due to the outgoing magistrates should be exacted by the incoming ones; and as regards those due to magistrates already in office,
when one court has given judgement, another should exact the penalty;
for example, the wardens of the city should exact the fines imposed by
the wardens of the agora, and others again should exact the fines imposed by them. For penalties are more likely to be exacted when less
odium attaches to the exaction of them; but a double odium is incurred
Politics/151
when the judges who have passed also execute the sentence, and if they
are always the executioners, they will be the enemies of all.
In many places, while one magistracy executes the sentence, another has the custody of the prisoners, as, for example, ‘the Eleven’ at
Athens. It is well to separate off the jailorship also, and try by some
device to render the office less unpopular. For it is quite as necessary as
that of the executioners; but good men do all they can to avoid it, and
worthless persons cannot safely be trusted with it; for they themselves
require a guard, and are not fit to guard others. There ought not therefore to be a single or permanent officer set apart for this duty; but it
should be entrusted to the young, wherever they are organized into a
band or guard, and different magistrates acting in turn should take charge
of it.
These are the indispensable officers, and should be ranked first;
next in order follow others, equally necessary, but of higher rank, and
requiring great experience and fidelity. Such are the officers to which
are committed the guard of the city, and other military functions. Not
only in time of war but of peace their duty will be to defend the walls
and gates, and to muster and marshal the citizens. In some states there
are many such offices; in others there are a few only, while small states
are content with one; these officers are called generals or commanders.
Again, if a state has cavalry or light-armed troops or archers or a naval
force, it will sometimes happen that each of these departments has separate officers, who are called admirals, or generals of cavalry or of lightarmed troops. And there are subordinate officers called naval captains,
and captains of light-armed troops and of horse; having others under
them: all these are included in the department of war. Thus much of
military command.
But since many, not to say all, of these offices handle the public
money, there must of necessity be another office which examines and
audits them, and has no other functions. Such officers are called by
various names—Scrutineers, Auditors, Accountants, Controllers. Besides all these offices there is another which is supreme over them, and
to this is often entrusted both the introduction and the ratification of
measures, or at all events it presides, in a democracy, over the assembly.
For there must be a body which convenes the supreme authority in the
state. In some places they are called ‘probuli,’ because they hold previous deliberations, but in a democracy more commonly ‘councillors.’
These are the chief political offices.
152/Aristotle
Another set of officers is concerned with the maintenance of religion priests and guardians see to the preservation and repair of the temples
of the Gods and to other matters of religion. One office of this sort may
be enough in small places, but in larger ones there are a great many
besides the priesthood; for example, superintendents of public worship,
guardians of shrines, treasurers of the sacred revenues. Nearly connected
with these there are also the officers appointed for the performance of
the public sacrifices, except any which the law assigns to the priests;
such sacrifices derive their dignity from the public hearth of the city.
They are sometimes called archons, sometimes kings, and sometimes
prytanes.
These, then, are the necessary offices, which may be summed up as
follows: offices concerned with matters of religion, with war, with the
revenue and expenditure, with the market, with the city, with the harbors, with the country; also with the courts of law, with the records of
contracts, with execution of sentences, with custody of prisoners, with
audits and scrutinies and accounts of magistrates; lastly, there are those
which preside over the public deliberations of the state. There are likewise magistracies characteristic of states which are peaceful and prosperous, and at the same time have a regard to good order: such as the
offices of guardians of women, guardians of the law, guardians of children, and directors of gymnastics; also superintendents of gymnastic
and Dionysiac contests, and of other similar spectacles. Some of these
are clearly not democratic offices; for example, the guardianships of
women and children—the poor, not having any slaves, must employ
both their women and children as servants.
Once more: there are three offices according to whose directions the
highest magistrates are chosen in certain states—guardians of the law,
probuli, councillors—of these, the guardians of the law are an
aristocratical, the probuli an oligarchical, the council a democratical
institution. Enough of the different kinds of offices.
BOOK SEVEN
Part I
He who would duly inquire about the best form of a state ought first to
determine which is the most eligible life; while this remains uncertain
the best form of the state must also be uncertain; for, in the natural order
of things, those may be expected to lead the best life who are governed
in the best manner of which their circumstances admit. We ought there-
Politics/153
fore to ascertain, first of all, which is the most generally eligible life,
and then whether the same life is or is not best for the state and for
individuals.
Assuming that enough has been already said in discussions outside
the school concerning the best life, we will now only repeat what is
contained in them. Certainly no one will dispute the propriety of that
partition of goods which separates them into three classes, viz., external
goods, goods of the body, and goods of the soul, or deny that the happy
man must have all three. For no one would maintain that he is happy
who has not in him a particle of courage or temperance or justice or
prudence, who is afraid of every insect which flutters past him, and will
commit any crime, however great, in order to gratify his lust of meat or
drink, who will sacrifice his dearest friend for the sake of half-a-farthing, and is as feeble and false in mind as a child or a madman. These
propositions are almost universally acknowledged as soon as they are
uttered, but men differ about the degree or relative superiority of this or
that good. Some think that a very moderate amount of virtue is enough,
but set no limit to their desires of wealth, property, power, reputation,
and the like. To whom we reply by an appeal to facts, which easily
prove that mankind do not acquire or preserve virtue by the help of
external goods, but external goods by the help of virtue, and that happiness, whether consisting in pleasure or virtue, or both, is more often
found with those who are most highly cultivated in their mind and in
their character, and have only a moderate share of external goods, than
among those who possess external goods to a useless extent but are
deficient in higher qualities; and this is not only matter of experience,
but, if reflected upon, will easily appear to be in accordance with reason. For, whereas external goods have a limit, like any other instrument,
and all things useful are of such a nature that where there is too much of
them they must either do harm, or at any rate be of no use, to their
possessors, every good of the soul, the greater it is, is also of greater
use, if the epithet useful as well as noble is appropriate to such subjects.
No proof is required to show that the best state of one thing in relation to
another corresponds in degree of excellence to the interval between the
natures of which we say that these very states are states: so that, if the
soul is more noble than our possessions or our bodies, both absolutely
and in relation to us, it must be admitted that the best state of either has
a similar ratio to the other. Again, it is for the sake of the soul that goods
external and goods of the body are eligible at all, and all wise men ought
154/Aristotle
to choose them for the sake of the soul, and not the soul for the sake of
them.
Let us acknowledge then that each one has just so much of happiness as he has of virtue and wisdom, and of virtuous and wise action.
God is a witness to us of this truth, for he is happy and blessed, not by
reason of any external good, but in himself and by reason of his own
nature. And herein of necessity lies the difference between good fortune
and happiness; for external goods come of themselves, and chance is the
author of them, but no one is just or temperate by or through chance. In
like manner, and by a similar train of argument, the happy state may be
shown to be that which is best and which acts rightly; and rightly it
cannot act without doing right actions, and neither individual nor state
can do right actions without virtue and wisdom. Thus the courage, justice, and wisdom of a state have the same form and nature as the qualities which give the individual who possesses them the name of just,
wise, or temperate.
Thus much may suffice by way of preface: for I could not avoid
touching upon these questions, neither could I go through all the arguments affecting them; these are the business of another science.
Let us assume then that the best life, both for individuals and states,
is the life of virtue, when virtue has external goods enough for the performance of good actions. If there are any who controvert our assertion,
we will in this treatise pass them over, and consider their objections
hereafter.
Part II
There remains to be discussed the question whether the happiness of the
individual is the same as that of the state, or different. Here again there
can be no doubt—no one denies that they are the same. For those who
hold that the well-being of the individual consists in his wealth, also
think that riches make the happiness of the whole state, and those who
value most highly the life of a tyrant deem that city the happiest which
rules over the greatest number; while they who approve an individual
for his virtue say that the more virtuous a city is, the happier it is. Two
points here present themselves for consideration: first (1), which is the
more eligible life, that of a citizen who is a member of a state, or that of
an alien who has no political ties; and again (2), which is the best form
of constitution or the best condition of a state, either on the supposition
that political privileges are desirable for all, or for a majority only?
Politics/155
Since the good of the state and not of the individual is the proper subject
of political thought and speculation, and we are engaged in a political
discussion, while the first of these two points has a secondary interest
for us, the latter will be the main subject of our inquiry.
Now it is evident that the form of government is best in which every
man, whoever he is, can act best and live happily. But even those who
agree in thinking that the life of virtue is the most eligible raise a question, whether the life of business and politics is or is not more eligible
than one which is wholly independent of external goods, I mean than a
contemplative life, which by some is maintained to be the only one worthy of a philosopher. For these two lives—the life of the philosopher and
the life of the statesman—appear to have been preferred by those who
have been most keen in the pursuit of virtue, both in our own and in
other ages. Which is the better is a question of no small moment; for the
wise man, like the wise state, will necessarily regulate his life according
to the best end. There are some who think that while a despotic rule over
others is the greatest injustice, to exercise a constitutional rule over
them, even though not unjust, is a great impediment to a man’s individual wellbeing. Others take an opposite view; they maintain that the
true life of man is the practical and political, and that every virtue admits of being practiced, quite as much by statesmen and rulers as by
private individuals. Others, again, are of opinion that arbitrary and tyrannical rule alone consists with happiness; indeed, in some states the
entire aim both of the laws and of the constitution is to give men despotic power over their neighbors. And, therefore, although in most cities
the laws may be said generally to be in a chaotic state, still, if they aim
at anything, they aim at the maintenance of power: thus in Lacedaemon
and Crete the system of education and the greater part of the of the laws
are framed with a view to war. And in all nations which are able to
gratify their ambition military power is held in esteem, for example
among the Scythians and Persians and Thracians and Celts.
In some nations there are even laws tending to stimulate the warlike
virtues, as at Carthage, where we are told that men obtain the honor of
wearing as many armlets as they have served campaigns. There was
once a law in Macedonia that he who had not killed an enemy should
wear a halter, and among the Scythians no one who had not slain his
man was allowed to drink out of the cup which was handed round at a
certain feast. Among the Iberians, a warlike nation, the number of enemies whom a man has slain is indicated by the number of obelisks
156/Aristotle
which are fixed in the earth round his tomb; and there are numerous
practices among other nations of a like kind, some of them established
by law and others by custom. Yet to a reflecting mind it must appear
very strange that the statesman should be always considering how he
can dominate and tyrannize over others, whether they will or not. How
can that which is not even lawful be the business of the statesman or the
legislator? Unlawful it certainly is to rule without regard to justice, for
there may be might where there is no right. The other arts and sciences
offer no parallel a physician is not expected to persuade or coerce his
patients, nor a pilot the passengers in his ship. Yet most men appear to
think that the art of despotic government is statesmanship, and what
men affirm to be unjust and inexpedient in their own case they are not
ashamed of practicing towards others; they demand just rule for themselves, but where other men are concerned they care nothing about it.
Such behavior is irrational; unless the one party is, and the other is not,
born to serve, in which case men have a right to command, not indeed
all their fellows, but only those who are intended to be subjects; just as
we ought not to hunt mankind, whether for food or sacrifice, but only
the animals which may be hunted for food or sacrifice, this is to say,
such wild animals as are eatable. And surely there may be a city happy
in isolation, which we will assume to be well-governed (for it is quite
possible that a city thus isolated might be well-administered and have
good laws); but such a city would not be constituted with any view to
war or the conquest of enemies—all that sort of thing must be excluded.
Hence we see very plainly that warlike pursuits, although generally to
be deemed honorable, are not the supreme end of all things, but only
means. And the good lawgiver should inquire how states and races of
men and communities may participate in a good life, and in the happiness which is attainable by them. His enactments will not be always the
same; and where there are neighbors he will have to see what sort of
studies should be practiced in relation to their several characters, or
how the measures appropriate in relation to each are to be adopted. The
end at which the best form of government should aim may be properly
made a matter of future consideration.
Part III
Let us now address those who, while they agree that the life of virtue is
the most eligible, differ about the manner of practicing it. For some
renounce political power, and think that the life of the freeman is differ-
Politics/157
ent from the life of the statesman and the best of all; but others think the
life of the statesman best. The argument of the latter is that he who does
nothing cannot do well, and that virtuous activity is identical with happiness. To both we say: ‘you are partly right and partly wrong.’ first
class are right in affirming that the life of the freeman is better than the
life of the despot; for there is nothing grand or noble in having the use of
a slave, in so far as he is a slave; or in issuing commands about necessary things. But it is an error to suppose that every sort of rule is despotic like that of a master over slaves, for there is as great a difference
between the rule over freemen and the rule over slaves as there is between slavery by nature and freedom by nature, about which I have said
enough at the commencement of this treatise. And it is equally a mistake
to place inactivity above action, for happiness is activity, and the actions of the just and wise are the realization of much that is noble.
But perhaps some one, accepting these premises, may still maintain
that supreme power is the best of all things, because the possessors of it
are able to perform the greatest number of noble actions. if so, the man
who is able to rule, instead of giving up anything to his neighbor, ought
rather to take away his power; and the father should make no account of
his son, nor the son of his father, nor friend of friend; they should not
bestow a thought on one another in comparison with this higher object,
for the best is the most eligible and ‘doing eligible’ and ‘doing well’ is
the best. There might be some truth in such a view if we assume that
robbers and plunderers attain the chief good. But this can never be; their
hypothesis is false. For the actions of a ruler cannot really be honorable,
unless he is as much superior to other men as a husband is to a wife, or
a father to his children, or a master to his slaves. And therefore he who
violates the law can never recover by any success, however great, what
he has already lost in departing from virtue. For equals the honorable
and the just consist in sharing alike, as is just and equal. But that the
unequal should be given to equals, and the unlike to those who are like,
is contrary to nature, and nothing which is contrary to nature is good. If,
therefore, there is any one superior in virtue and in the power of performing the best actions, him we ought to follow and obey, but he must
have the capacity for action as well as virtue.
If we are right in our view, and happiness is assumed to be virtuous
activity, the active life will be the best, both for every city collectively,
and for individuals. Not that a life of action must necessarily have relation to others, as some persons think, nor are those ideas only to be
158/Aristotle
regarded as practical which are pursued for the sake of practical results,
but much more the thoughts and contemplations which are independent
and complete in themselves; since virtuous activity, and therefore a certain kind of action, is an end, and even in the case of external actions the
directing mind is most truly said to act. Neither, again, is it necessary
that states which are cut off from others and choose to live alone should
be inactive; for activity, as well as other things, may take place by sections; there are many ways in which the sections of a state act upon one
another. The same thing is equally true of every individual. If this were
otherwise, God and the universe, who have no external actions over and
above their own energies, would be far enough from perfection. Hence
it is evident that the same life is best for each individual, and for states
and for mankind collectively
Part IV
Thus far by way of introduction. In what has preceded I have discussed
other forms of government; in what remains the first point to be considered is what should be the conditions of the ideal or perfect state; for the
perfect state cannot exist without a due supply of the means of life. And
therefore we must presuppose many purely imaginary conditions, but
nothing impossible. There will be a certain number of citizens, a country in which to place them, and the like. As the weaver or shipbuilder or
any other artisan must have the material proper for his work (and in
proportion as this is better prepared, so will the result of his art be
nobler), so the statesman or legislator must also have the materials suited
to him.
First among the materials required by the statesman is population:
he will consider what should be the number and character of the citizens, and then what should be the size and character of the country.
Most persons think that a state in order to be happy ought to be large;
but even if they are right, they have no idea what is a large and what a
small state. For they judge of the size of the city by the number of the
inhabitants; whereas they ought to regard, not their number, but their
power. A city too, like an individual, has a work to do; and that city
which is best adapted to the fulfillment of its work is to be deemed
greatest, in the same sense of the word great in which Hippocrates might
be called greater, not as a man, but as a physician, than some one else
who was taller And even if we reckon greatness by numbers, we ought
not to include everybody, for there must always be in cities a multitude
Politics/159
of slaves and sojourners and foreigners; but we should include those
only who are members of the state, and who form an essential part of it.
The number of the latter is a proof of the greatness of a city; but a city
which produces numerous artisans and comparatively few soldiers cannot be great, for a great city is not to be confounded with a populous
one. Moreover, experience shows that a very populous city can rarely, if
ever, be well governed; since all cities which have a reputation for good
government have a limit of population. We may argue on grounds of
reason, and the same result will follow. For law is order, and good law
is good order; but a very great multitude cannot be orderly: to introduce
order into the unlimited is the work of a divine power—of such a power
as holds together the universe. Beauty is realized in number and magnitude, and the state which combines magnitude with good order must
necessarily be the most beautiful. To the size of states there is a limit, as
there is to other things, plants, animals, implements; for none of these
retain their natural power when they are too large or too small, but they
either wholly lose their nature, or are spoiled. For example, a ship which
is only a span long will not be a ship at all, nor a ship a quarter of a mile
long; yet there may be a ship of a certain size, either too large or too
small, which will still be a ship, but bad for sailing. In like manner a
state when composed of too few is not, as a state ought to be, selfsufficing; when of too many, though self-sufficing in all mere necessaries, as a nation may be, it is not a state, being almost incapable of
constitutional government. For who can be the general of such a vast
multitude, or who the herald, unless he have the voice of a Stentor?
A state, then, only begins to exist when it has attained a population
sufficient for a good life in the political community: it may indeed, if it
somewhat exceed this number, be a greater state. But, as I was saying,
there must be a limit. What should be the limit will be easily ascertained
by experience. For both governors and governed have duties to perform; the special functions of a governor to command and to judge. But
if the citizens of a state are to judge and to distribute offices according
to merit, then they must know each other’s characters; where they do
not possess this knowledge, both the election to offices and the decision
of lawsuits will go wrong. When the population is very large they are
manifestly settled at haphazard, which clearly ought not to be. Besides,
in an over-populous state foreigners and metics will readily acquire the
rights of citizens, for who will find them out? Clearly then the best limit
of the population of a state is the largest number which suffices for the
160/Aristotle
purposes of life, and can be taken in at a single view. Enough concerning the size of a state.
Part V
Much the same principle will apply to the territory of the state: every
one would agree in praising the territory which is most entirely selfsufficing; and that must be the territory which is all-producing, for to
have all things and to want nothing is sufficiency. In size and extent it
should be such as may enable the inhabitants to live at once temperately
and liberally in the enjoyment of leisure. Whether we are right or wrong
in laying down this limit we will inquire more precisely hereafter, when
we have occasion to consider what is the right use of property and wealth:
a matter which is much disputed, because men are inclined to rush into
one of two extremes, some into meanness, others into luxury.
It is not difficult to determine the general character of the territory
which is required (there are, however, some points on which military
authorities should be heard); it should be difficult of access to the enemy, and easy of egress to the inhabitants. Further, we require that the
land as well as the inhabitants of whom we were just now speaking
should be taken in at a single view, for a country which is easily seen
can be easily protected. As to the position of the city, if we could have
what we wish, it should be well situated in regard both to sea and land.
This then is one principle, that it should be a convenient center for the
protection of the whole country: the other is, that it should be suitable
for receiving the fruits of the soil, and also for the bringing in of timber
and any other products that are easily transported.
Part VI
Whether a communication with the sea is beneficial to a well-ordered
state or not is a question which has often been asked. It is argued that
the introduction of strangers brought up under other laws, and the increase of population, will be adverse to good order; the increase arises
from their using the sea and having a crowd of merchants coming and
going, and is inimical to good government. Apart from these considerations, it would be undoubtedly better, both with a view to safety and to
the provision of necessaries, that the city and territory should be connected with the sea; the defenders of a country, if they are to maintain
themselves against an enemy, should be easily relieved both by land and
by sea; and even if they are not able to attack by sea and land at once,
Politics/161
they will have less difficulty in doing mischief to their assailants on one
element, if they themselves can use both. Moreover, it is necessary that
they should import from abroad what is not found in their own country,
and that they should export what they have in excess; for a city ought to
be a market, not indeed for others, but for herself.
Those who make themselves a market for the world only do so for
the sake of revenue, and if a state ought not to desire profit of this kind
it ought not to have such an emporium. Nowadays we often see in countries and cities dockyards and harbors very conveniently placed outside
the city, but not too far off; and they are kept in dependence by walls and
similar fortifications. Cities thus situated manifestly reap the benefit of
intercourse with their ports; and any harm which is likely to accrue may
be easily guarded against by the laws, which will pronounce and determine who may hold communication with one another, and who may not.
There can be no doubt that the possession of a moderate naval force
is advantageous to a city; the city should be formidable not only to its
own citizens but to some of its neighbors, or, if necessary, able to assist
them by sea as well as by land. The proper number or magnitude of this
naval force is relative to the character of the state; for if her function is
to take a leading part in politics, her naval power should be commensurate with the scale of her enterprises. The population of the state need
not be much increased, since there is no necessity that the sailors should
be citizens: the marines who have the control and command will be
freemen, and belong also to the infantry; and wherever there is a dense
population of Perioeci and husbandmen, there will always be sailors
more than enough. Of this we see instances at the present day. The city
of Heraclea, for example, although small in comparison with many others, can man a considerable fleet. Such are our conclusions respecting
the territory of the state, its harbors, its towns, its relations to the sea,
and its maritime power.
Part VII
Having spoken of the number of the citizens, we will proceed to speak
of what should be their character. This is a subject which can be easily
understood by any one who casts his eye on the more celebrated states
of Hellas, and generally on the distribution of races in the habitable
world. Those who live in a cold climate and in Europe are full of spirit,
but wanting in intelligence and skill; and therefore they retain comparative freedom, but have no political organization, and are incapable of
162/Aristotle
ruling over others. Whereas the natives of Asia are intelligent and inventive, but they are wanting in spirit, and therefore they are always in
a state of subjection and slavery. But the Hellenic race, which is situated
between them, is likewise intermediate in character, being high-spirited
and also intelligent. Hence it continues free, and is the best-governed of
any nation, and, if it could be formed into one state, would be able to
rule the world. There are also similar differences in the different tribes
of Hellas; for some of them are of a one-sided nature, and are intelligent
or courageous only, while in others there is a happy combination of both
qualities. And clearly those whom the legislator will most easily lead to
virtue may be expected to be both intelligent and courageous. Some say
that the guardians should be friendly towards those whom they know,
fierce towards those whom they do not know. Now, passion is the quality of the soul which begets friendship and enables us to love; notably
the spirit within us is more stirred against our friends and acquaintances
than against those who are unknown to us, when we think that we are
despised by them; for which reason Archilochus, complaining of his
friends, very naturally addresses his soul in these words:
“For surely thou art plagued on account of friends.”
The power of command and the love of freedom are in all men
based upon this quality, for passion is commanding and invincible. Nor
is it right to say that the guardians should be fierce towards those whom
they do not know, for we ought not to be out of temper with any one; and
a lofty spirit is not fierce by nature, but only when excited against evildoers. And this, as I was saying before, is a feeling which men show
most strongly towards their friends if they think they have received a
wrong at their hands: as indeed is reasonable; for, besides the actual
injury, they seem to be deprived of a benefit by those who owe them one.
Hence the saying:
“Cruel is the strife of brethren,”
and again:
“They who love in excess also hate in excess.”
Thus we have nearly determined the number and character of the
Politics/163
citizens of our state, and also the size and nature of their territory. I say
‘nearly,’ for we ought not to require the same minuteness in theory as in
the facts given by perception.
Part VIII
As in other natural compounds the conditions of a composite whole are
not necessarily organic parts of it, so in a state or in any other combination forming a unity not everything is a part, which is a necessary condition. The members of an association have necessarily some one thing
the same and common to all, in which they share equally or unequally
for example, food or land or any other thing. But where there are two
things of which one is a means and the other an end, they have nothing
in common except that the one receives what the other produces. Such,
for example, is the relation which workmen and tools stand to their
work; the house and the builder have nothing in common, but the art of
the builder is for the sake of the house. And so states require property,
but property, even though living beings are included in it, is no part of a
state; for a state is not a community of living beings only, but a community of equals, aiming at the best life possible. Now, whereas happiness
is the highest good, being a realization and perfect practice of virtue,
which some can attain, while others have little or none of it, the various
qualities of men are clearly the reason why there are various kinds of
states and many forms of government; for different men seek after happiness in different ways and by different means, and so make for themselves different modes of life and forms of government. We must see
also how many things are indispensable to the existence of a state, for
what we call the parts of a state will be found among the indispensables.
Let us then enumerate the functions of a state, and we shall easily elicit
what we want:
First, there must be food; secondly, arts, for life requires many instruments; thirdly, there must be arms, for the members of a community
have need of them, and in their own hands, too, in order to maintain
authority both against disobedient subjects and against external assailants; fourthly, there must be a certain amount of revenue, both for internal needs, and for the purposes of war; fifthly, or rather first, there must
be a care of religion which is commonly called worship; sixthly, and
most necessary of all there must be a power of deciding what is for the
public interest, and what is just in men’s dealings with one another.
These are the services which every state may be said to need. For a
164/Aristotle
state is not a mere aggregate of persons, but a union of them sufficing
for the purposes of life; and if any of these things be wanting, it is as we
maintain impossible that the community can be absolutely self-sufficing. A state then should be framed with a view to the fulfillment of these
functions. There must be husbandmen to procure food, and artisans,
and a warlike and a wealthy class, and priests, and judges to decide
what is necessary and expedient.
Part IX
Having determined these points, we have in the next place to consider
whether all ought to share in every sort of occupation. Shall every man
be at once husbandman, artisan, councillor, judge, or shall we suppose
the several occupations just mentioned assigned to different persons?
or, thirdly, shall some employments be assigned to individuals and others common to all? The same arrangement, however, does not occur in
every constitution; as we were saying, all may be shared by all, or not
all by all, but only by some; and hence arise the differences of constitutions, for in democracies all share in all, in oligarchies the opposite
practice prevails. Now, since we are here speaking of the best form of
government, i.e., that under which the state will be most happy (and
happiness, as has been already said, cannot exist without virtue), it clearly
follows that in the state which is best governed and possesses men who
are just absolutely, and not merely relatively to the principle of the constitution, the citizens must not lead the life of mechanics or tradesmen,
for such a life is ignoble, and inimical to virtue. Neither must they be
husbandmen, since leisure is necessary both for the development of virtue and the performance of political duties.
Again, there is in a state a class of warriors, and another of councillors, who advise about the expedient and determine matters of law, and
these seem in an especial manner parts of a state. Now, should these two
classes be distinguished, or are both functions to be assigned to the
same persons? Here again there is no difficulty in seeing that both functions will in one way belong to the same, in another, to different persons.
To different persons in so far as these i.e., the physical and the employments are suited to different primes of life, for the one requires mental
wisdom and the other strength. But on the other hand, since it is an
impossible thing that those who are able to use or to resist force should
be willing to remain always in subjection, from this point of view the
persons are the same; for those who carry arms can always determine
Politics/165
the fate of the constitution. It remains therefore that both functions should
be entrusted by the ideal constitution to the same persons, not, however,
at the same time, but in the order prescribed by nature, who has given to
young men strength and to older men wisdom. Such a distribution of
duties will be expedient and also just, and is founded upon a principle of
conformity to merit. Besides, the ruling class should be the owners of
property, for they are citizens, and the citizens of a state should be in
good circumstances; whereas mechanics or any other class which is not
a producer of virtue have no share in the state. This follows from our
first principle, for happiness cannot exist without virtue, and a city is
not to be termed happy in regard to a portion of the citizens, but in
regard to them all. And clearly property should be in their hands, since
the husbandmen will of necessity be slaves or barbarian Perioeci.
Of the classes enumerated there remain only the priests, and the
manner in which their office is to be regulated is obvious. No husbandman or mechanic should be appointed to it; for the Gods should receive
honor from the citizens only. Now since the body of the citizen is divided into two classes, the warriors and the councillors and it is beseeming
that the worship of the Gods should be duly performed, and also a rest
provided in their service for those who from age have given up active
life, to the old men of these two classes should be assigned the duties of
the priesthood.
We have shown what are the necessary conditions, and what the
parts of a state: husbandmen, craftsmen, and laborers of an kinds are
necessary to the existence of states, but the parts of the state are the
warriors and councillors. And these are distinguished severally from
one another, the distinction being in some cases permanent, in others
not.
Part X
It is not a new or recent discovery of political philosophers that the state
ought to be divided into classes, and that the warriors should be separated from the husbandmen. The system has continued in Egypt and in
Crete to this day, and was established, as tradition says, by a law of
Sesostris in Egypt and of Minos in Crete. The institution of common
tables also appears to be of ancient date, being in Crete as old as the
reign of Minos, and in Italy far older. The Italian historians say that
there was a certain Italus, king of Oenotria, from whom the Oenotrians
were called Italians, and who gave the name of Italy to the promontory
166/Aristotle
of Europe lying within the Scylletic and Lametic Gulfs, which are distant from one another only half a day’s journey. They say that this Italus
converted the Oenotrians from shepherds into husbandmen, and besides
other laws which he gave them, was the founder of their common meals;
even in our day some who are derived from him retain this institution
and certain other laws of his. On the side of Italy towards Tyrrhenia
dwelt the Opici, who are now, as of old, called Ausones; and on the side
towards Iapygia and the Ionian Gulf, in the district called Siritis, the
Chones, who are likewise of Oenotrian race. From this part of the world
originally came the institution of common tables; the separation into
castes from Egypt, for the reign of Sesostris is of far greater antiquity
than that of Minos. It is true indeed that these and many other things
have been invented several times over in the course of ages, or rather
times without number; for necessity may be supposed to have taught
men the inventions which were absolutely required, and when these were
provided, it was natural that other things which would adorn and enrich
life should grow up by degrees. And we may infer that in political institutions the same rule holds. Egypt witnesses to the antiquity of all these
things, for the Egyptians appear to be of all people the most ancient; and
they have laws and a regular constitution existing from time immemorial. We should therefore make the best use of what has been already
discovered, and try to supply defects.
I have already remarked that the land ought to belong to those who
possess arms and have a share in the government, and that the husbandmen ought to be a class distinct from them; and I have determined what
should be the extent and nature of the territory. Let me proceed to discuss the distribution of the land, and the character of the agricultural
class; for I do not think that property ought to be common, as some
maintain, but only that by friendly consent there should be a common
use of it; and that no citizen should be in want of subsistence.
As to common meals, there is a general agreement that a well ordered city should have them; and we will hereafter explain what are our
own reasons for taking this view. They ought, however, to be open to all
the citizens. And yet it is not easy for the poor to contribute the requisite
sum out of their private means, and to provide also for their household.
The expense of religious worship should likewise be a public charge.
The land must therefore be divided into two parts, one public and the
other private, and each part should be subdivided, part of the public
land being appropriated to the service of the Gods, and the other part
Politics/167
used to defray the cost of the common meals; while of the private land,
part should be near the border, and the other near the city, so that, each
citizen having two lots, they may all of them have land in both places;
there is justice and fairness in such a division, and it tends to inspire
unanimity among the people in their border wars. Where there is not
this arrangement some of them are too ready to come to blows with their
neighbors, while others are so cautious that they quite lose the sense of
honor. Wherefore there is a law in some places which forbids those who
dwell near the border to take part in public deliberations about wars
with neighbors, on the ground that their interests will pervert their judgment. For the reasons already mentioned, then, the land should be divided in the manner described. The very best thing of all would be that
the husbandmen should be slaves taken from among men who are not all
of the same race and not spirited, for if they have no spirit they will be
better suited for their work, and there will be no danger of their making
a revolution. The next best thing would be that they should be Perioeci
of foreign race, and of a like inferior nature; some of them should be the
slaves of individuals, and employed in the private estates of men of
property, the remainder should be the property of the state and employed
on the common land. I will hereafter explain what is the proper treatment of slaves, and why it is expedient that liberty should be always
held out to them as the reward of their services.
Part XI
We have already said that the city should be open to the land and to the
sea, and to the whole country as far as possible. In respect of the place
itself our wish would be that its situation should be fortunate in four
things. The first, health—this is a necessity: cities which lie towards the
east, and are blown upon by winds coming from the east, are the healthiest; next in healthfulness are those which are sheltered from the north
wind, for they have a milder winter. The site of the city should likewise
be convenient both for political administration and for war. With a view
to the latter it should afford easy egress to the citizens, and at the same
time be inaccessible and difficult of capture to enemies. There should be
a natural abundance of springs and fountains in the town, or, if there is
a deficiency of them, great reservoirs may be established for the collection of rainwater, such as will not fail when the inhabitants are cut off
from the country by by war. Special care should be taken of the health
of the inhabitants, which will depend chiefly on the healthiness of the
168/Aristotle
locality and of the quarter to which they are exposed, and secondly, on
the use of pure water; this latter point is by no means a secondary consideration. For the elements which we use most and oftenest for the
support of the body contribute most to health, and among these are
water and air. Wherefore, in all wise states, if there is a want of pure
water, and the supply is not all equally good, the drinking water ought to
be separated from that which is used for other purposes.
As to strongholds, what is suitable to different forms of government
varies: thus an acropolis is suited to an oligarchy or a monarchy, but a
plain to a democracy; neither to an aristocracy, but rather a number of
strong places. The arrangement of private houses is considered to be
more agreeable and generally more convenient, if the streets are regularly laid out after the modern fashion which Hippodamus introduced,
but for security in war the antiquated mode of building, which made it
difficult for strangers to get out of a town and for assailants to find their
way in, is preferable. A city should therefore adopt both plans of building: it is possible to arrange the houses irregularly, as husbandmen plant
their vines in what are called ‘clumps.’ The whole town should not be
laid out in straight lines, but only certain quarters and regions; thus
security and beauty will be combined.
As to walls, those who say that cities making any pretension to
military virtue should not have them, are quite out of date in their notions; and they may see the cities which prided themselves on this fancy
confuted by facts. True, there is little courage shown in seeking for
safety behind a rampart when an enemy is similar in character and not
much superior in number; but the superiority of the besiegers may be
and often is too much both for ordinary human valor and for that which
is found only in a few; and if they are to be saved and to escape defeat
and outrage, the strongest wall will be the truest soldierly precaution,
more especially now that missiles and siege engines have been brought
to such perfection. To have no walls would be as foolish as to choose a
site for a town in an exposed country, and to level the heights; or as if an
individual were to leave his house unwalled, lest the inmates should
become cowards. Nor must we forget that those who have their cities
surrounded by walls may either take advantage of them or not, but cities
which are unwalled have no choice.
If our conclusions are just, not only should cities have walls, but
care should be taken to make them ornamental, as well as useful for
warlike purposes, and adapted to resist modern inventions. For as the
Politics/169
assailants of a city do all they can to gain an advantage, so the defenders
should make use of any means of defense which have been already discovered, and should devise and invent others, for when men are well
prepared no enemy even thinks of attacking them.
Part XII
As the walls are to be divided by guardhouses and towers built at suitable intervals, and the body of citizens must be distributed at common
tables, the idea will naturally occur that we should establish some of the
common tables in the guardhouses. These might be arranged as has
been suggested; while the principal common tables of the magistrates
will occupy a suitable place, and there also will be the buildings appropriated to religious worship except in the case of those rites which the
law or the Pythian oracle has restricted to a special locality. The site
should be a spot seen far and wide, which gives due elevation to virtue
and towers over the neighborhood. Below this spot should be established an agora, such as that which the Thessalians call the ‘freemen’s
agora’; from this all trade should be excluded, and no mechanic, husbandman, or any such person allowed to enter, unless he be summoned
by the magistrates. It would be a charming use of the place, if the gymnastic exercises of the elder men were performed there. For in this noble
practice different ages should be separated, and some of the magistrates
should stay with the boys, while the grown-up men remain with the
magistrates; for the presence of the magistrates is the best mode of inspiring true modesty and ingenuous fear. There should also be a traders’
agora, distinct and apart from the other, in a situation which is convenient for the reception of goods both by sea and land.
But in speaking of the magistrates we must not forget another section of the citizens, viz., the priests, for whom public tables should likewise be provided in their proper place near the temples. The magistrates
who deal with contracts, indictments, summonses, and the like, and those
who have the care of the agora and of the city, respectively, ought to be
established near an agora and some public place of meeting; the neighborhood of the traders’ agora will be a suitable spot; the upper agora we
devote to the life of leisure, the other is intended for the necessities of
trade.
The same order should prevail in the country, for there too the magistrates, called by some ‘Inspectors of Forests’ and by others ‘Wardens
of the Country,’ must have guardhouses and common tables while they
170/Aristotle
are on duty; temples should also be scattered throughout the country,
dedicated, some to Gods, and some to heroes.
But it would be a waste of time for us to linger over details like
these. The difficulty is not in imagining but in carrying them out. We
may talk about them as much as we like, but the execution of them will
depend upon fortune. Wherefore let us say no more about these matters
for the present.
Part XIII
Returning to the constitution itself, let us seek to determine out of what
and what sort of elements the state which is to be happy and well-governed should be composed. There are two things in which all which all
well-being consists: one of them is the choice of a right end and aim of
action, and the other the discovery of the actions which are means towards it; for the means and the end may agree or disagree. Sometimes
the right end is set before men, but in practice they fail to attain it; in
other cases they are successful in all the means, but they propose to
themselves a bad end; and sometimes they fail in both. Take, for example, the art of medicine; physicians do not always understand the
nature of health, and also the means which they use may not effect the
desired end. In all arts and sciences both the end and the means should
be equally within our control.
The happiness and well-being which all men manifestly desire, some
have the power of attaining, but to others, from some accident or defect
of nature, the attainment of them is not granted; for a good life requires
a supply of external goods, in a less degree when men are in a good
state, in a greater degree when they are in a lower state. Others again,
who possess the conditions of happiness, go utterly wrong from the first
in the pursuit of it. But since our object is to discover the best form of
government, that, namely, under which a city will be best governed, and
since the city is best governed which has the greatest opportunity of
obtaining happiness, it is evident that we must clearly ascertain the nature of happiness.
We maintain, and have said in the Ethics, if the arguments there
adduced are of any value, that happiness is the realization and perfect
exercise of virtue, and this not conditional, but absolute. And I used the
term ‘conditional’ to express that which is indispensable, and ‘absolute’
to express that which is good in itself. Take the case of just actions; just
punishments and chastisements do indeed spring from a good principle,
Politics/171
but they are good only because we cannot do without them—it would be
better that neither individuals nor states should need anything of the
sort—but actions which aim at honor and advantage are absolutely the
best. The conditional action is only the choice of a lesser evil; whereas
these are the foundation and creation of good. A good man may make
the best even of poverty and disease, and the other ills of life; but he can
only attain happiness under the opposite conditions (for this also has
been determined in accordance with ethical arguments, that the good
man is he for whom, because he is virtuous, the things that are absolutely good are good; it is also plain that his use of these goods must be
virtuous and in the absolute sense good). This makes men fancy that
external goods are the cause of happiness, yet we might as well say that
a brilliant performance on the lyre was to be attributed to the instrument
and not to the skill of the performer.
It follows then from what has been said that some things the legislator must find ready to his hand in a state, others he must provide. And
therefore we can only say: May our state be constituted in such a manner as to be blessed with the goods of which fortune disposes (for we
acknowledge her power): whereas virtue and goodness in the state are
not a matter of chance but the result of knowledge and purpose. A city
can be virtuous only when the citizens who have a share in the government are virtuous, and in our state all the citizens share in the government; let us then inquire how a man becomes virtuous. For even if we
could suppose the citizen body to be virtuous, without each of them
being so, yet the latter would be better, for in the virtue of each the
virtue of all is involved.
There are three things which make men good and virtuous; these are
nature, habit, rational principle. In the first place, every one must be
born a man and not some other animal; so, too, he must have a certain
character, both of body and soul. But some qualities there is no use in
having at birth, for they are altered by habit, and there are some gifts
which by nature are made to be turned by habit to good or bad. Animals
lead for the most part a life of nature, although in lesser particulars
some are influenced by habit as well. Man has rational principle, in
addition, and man only. Wherefore nature, habit, rational principle must
be in harmony with one another; for they do not always agree; men do
many things against habit and nature, if rational principle persuades
them that they ought. We have already determined what natures are
likely to be most easily molded by the hands of the legislator. An else is
172/Aristotle
the work of education; we learn some things by habit and some by instruction.
Part XIV
Since every political society is composed of rulers and subjects let us
consider whether the relations of one to the other should interchange or
be permanent. For the education of the citizens will necessarily vary
with the answer given to this question. Now, if some men excelled others in the same degree in which gods and heroes are supposed to excel
mankind in general (having in the first place a great advantage even in
their bodies, and secondly in their minds), so that the superiority of the
governors was undisputed and patent to their subjects, it would clearly
be better that once for an the one class should rule and the other serve.
But since this is unattainable, and kings have no marked superiority
over their subjects, such as Scylax affirms to be found among the Indians, it is obviously necessary on many grounds that all the citizens alike
should take their turn of governing and being governed. Equality consists in the same treatment of similar persons, and no government can
stand which is not founded upon justice. For if the government be unjust
every one in the country unites with the governed in the desire to have a
revolution, and it is an impossibility that the members of the government can be so numerous as to be stronger than all their enemies put
together. Yet that governors should excel their subjects is undeniable.
How all this is to be effected, and in what way they will respectively
share in the government, the legislator has to consider. The subject has
been already mentioned. Nature herself has provided the distinction when
she made a difference between old and young within the same species,
of whom she fitted the one to govern and the other to be governed. No
one takes offense at being governed when he is young, nor does he think
himself better than his governors, especially if he will enjoy the same
privilege when he reaches the required age.
We conclude that from one point of view governors and governed
are identical, and from another different. And therefore their education
must be the same and also different. For he who would learn to command well must, as men say, first of all learn to obey. As I observed in
the first part of this treatise, there is one rule which is for the sake of the
rulers and another rule which is for the sake of the ruled; the former is a
despotic, the latter a free government. Some commands differ not in the
thing commanded, but in the intention with which they are imposed.
Politics/173
Wherefore, many apparently menial offices are an honor to the free
youth by whom they are performed; for actions do not differ as honorable or dishonorable in themselves so much as in the end and intention
of them. But since we say that the virtue of the citizen and ruler is the
same as that of the good man, and that the same person must first be a
subject and then a ruler, the legislator has to see that they become good
men, and by what means this may be accomplished, and what is the end
of the perfect life.
Now the soul of man is divided into two parts, one of which has a
rational principle in itself, and the other, not having a rational principle
in itself, is able to obey such a principle. And we call a man in any way
good because he has the virtues of these two parts. In which of them the
end is more likely to be found is no matter of doubt to those who adopt
our division; for in the world both of nature and of art the inferior always exists for the sake of the better or superior, and the better or superior is that which has a rational principle. This principle, too, in our
ordinary way of speaking, is divided into two kinds, for there is a practical and a speculative principle. This part, then, must evidently be similarly divided. And there must be a corresponding division of actions; the
actions of the naturally better part are to be preferred by those who have
it in their power to attain to two out of the three or to all, for that is
always to every one the most eligible which is the highest attainable by
him. The whole of life is further divided into two parts, business and
leisure, war and peace, and of actions some aim at what is necessary
and useful, and some at what is honorable. And the preference given to
one or the other class of actions must necessarily be like the preference
given to one or other part of the soul and its actions over the other; there
must be war for the sake of peace, business for the sake of leisure,
things useful and necessary for the sake of things honorable. All these
points the statesman should keep in view when he frames his laws; he
should consider the parts of the soul and their functions, and above all
the better and the end; he should also remember the diversities of human
lives and actions. For men must be able to engage in business and go to
war, but leisure and peace are better; they must do what is necessary
and indeed what is useful, but what is honorable is better. On such
principles children and persons of every age which requires education
should be trained. Whereas even the Hellenes of the present day who are
reputed to be best governed, and the legislators who gave them their
constitutions, do not appear to have framed their governments with a
174/Aristotle
regard to the best end, or to have given them laws and education with a
view to all the virtues, but in a vulgar spirit have fallen back on those
which promised to be more useful and profitable. Many modern writers
have taken a similar view: they commend the Lacedaemonian constitution, and praise the legislator for making conquest and war his sole aim,
a doctrine which may be refuted by argument and has long ago been
refuted by facts. For most men desire empire in the hope of accumulating the goods of fortune; and on this ground Thibron and all those who
have written about the Lacedaemonian constitution have praised their
legislator, because the Lacedaemonians, by being trained to meet dangers, gained great power. But surely they are not a happy people now
that their empire has passed away, nor was their legislator right. How
ridiculous is the result, if, when they are continuing in the observance of
his laws and no one interferes with them, they have lost the better part of
life! These writers further err about the sort of government which the
legislator should approve, for the government of freemen is nobler and
implies more virtue than despotic government. Neither is a city to be
deemed happy or a legislator to be praised because he trains his citizens
to conquer and obtain dominion over their neighbors, for there is great
evil in this. On a similar principle any citizen who could, should obviously try to obtain the power in his own state—the crime which the
Lacedaemonians accuse king Pausanias of attempting, although he had
so great honor already. No such principle and no law having this object
is either statesmanlike or useful or right. For the same things are best
both for individuals and for states, and these are the things which the
legislator ought to implant in the minds of his citizens.
Neither should men study war with a view to the enslavement of
those who do not deserve to be enslaved; but first of all they should
provide against their own enslavement, and in the second place obtain
empire for the good of the governed, and not for the sake of exercising a
general despotism, and in the third place they should seek to be masters
only over those who deserve to be slaves. Facts, as well as arguments,
prove that the legislator should direct all his military and other measures to the provision of leisure and the establishment of peace. For
most of these military states are safe only while they are at war, but fall
when they have acquired their empire; like unused iron they lose their
temper in time of peace. And for this the legislator is to blame, he never
having taught them how to lead the life of peace.
Politics/175
Part XV
Since the end of individuals and of states is the same, the end of the best
man and of the best constitution must also be the same; it is therefore
evident that there ought to exist in both of them the virtues of leisure; for
peace, as has been often repeated, is the end of war, and leisure of toil.
But leisure and cultivation may be promoted, not only by those virtues
which are practiced in leisure, but also by some of those which are
useful to business. For many necessaries of life have to be supplied
before we can have leisure. Therefore a city must be temperate and
brave, and able to endure: for truly, as the proverb says, ‘There is no
leisure for slaves,’ and those who cannot face danger like men are the
slaves of any invader. Courage and endurance are required for business
and philosophy for leisure, temperance and justice for both, and more
especially in times of peace and leisure, for war compels men to be just
and temperate, whereas the enjoyment of good fortune and the leisure
which comes with peace tend to make them insolent. Those then who
seem to be the best-off and to be in the possession of every good, have
special need of justice and temperance—for example, those (if such
there be, as the poets say) who dwell in the Islands of the Blest; they
above all will need philosophy and temperance and justice, and all the
more the more leisure they have, living in the midst of abundance. There
is no difficulty in seeing why the state that would be happy and good
ought to have these virtues. If it be disgraceful in men not to be able to
use the goods of life, it is peculiarly disgraceful not to be able to use
them in time of leisure—to show excellent qualities in action and war,
and when they have peace and leisure to be no better than slaves. Wherefore we should not practice virtue after the manner of the
Lacedaemonians. For they, while agreeing with other men in their conception of the highest goods, differ from the rest of mankind in thinking
that they are to be obtained by the practice of a single virtue. And since
they think these goods and the enjoyment of them greater than the enjoyment derived from the virtues ... and that it should be practiced for its
own sake, is evident from what has been said; we must now consider
how and by what means it is to be attained.
We have already determined that nature and habit and rational principle are required, and, of these, the proper nature of the citizens has
also been defined by us. But we have still to consider whether the training of early life is to be that of rational principle or habit, for these two
must accord, and when in accord they will then form the best of harmo-
176/Aristotle
nies. The rational principle may be mistaken and fail in attaining the
highest ideal of life, and there may be a like evil influence of habit. Thus
much is clear in the first place, that, as in all other things, birth implies
an antecedent beginning, and that there are beginnings whose end is
relative to a further end. Now, in men rational principle and mind are
the end towards which nature strives, so that the birth and moral discipline of the citizens ought to be ordered with a view to them. In the
second place, as the soul and body are two, we see also that there are
two parts of the soul, the rational and the irrational, and two corresponding states—reason and appetite. And as the body is prior in order
of generation to the soul, so the irrational is prior to the rational. The
proof is that anger and wishing and desire are implanted in children
from their very birth, but reason and understanding are developed as
they grow older. Wherefore, the care of the body ought to precede that
of the soul, and the training of the appetitive part should follow: none
the less our care of it must be for the sake of the reason, and our care of
the body for the sake of the soul.
Part XVI
Since the legislator should begin by considering how the frames of the
children whom he is rearing may be as good as possible, his first care
will be about marriage—at what age should his citizens marry, and who
are fit to marry? In legislating on this subject he ought to consider the
persons and the length of their life, that their procreative life may terminate at the same period, and that they may not differ in their bodily
powers, as will be the case if the man is still able to beget children while
the woman is unable to bear them, or the woman able to bear while the
man is unable to beget, for from these causes arise quarrels and differences between married persons. Secondly, he must consider the time at
which the children will succeed to their parents; there ought not to be
too great an interval of age, for then the parents will be too old to derive
any pleasure from their affection, or to be of any use to them. Nor ought
they to be too nearly of an age; to youthful marriages there are many
objections—the children will be wanting in respect to the parents, who
will seem to be their contemporaries, and disputes will arise in the management of the household. Thirdly, and this is the point from which we
digressed, the legislator must mold to his will the frames of newly-born
children. Almost all these objects may be secured by attention to one
point. Since the time of generation is commonly limited within the age
Politics/177
of seventy years in the case of a man, and of fifty in the case of a
woman, the commencement of the union should conform to these periods. The union of male and female when too young is bad for the procreation of children; in all other animals the offspring of the young are
small and in-developed, and with a tendency to produce female children, and therefore also in man, as is proved by the fact that in those
cities in which men and women are accustomed to marry young, the
people are small and weak; in childbirth also younger women suffer
more, and more of them die; some persons say that this was the meaning
of the response once given to the Troezenians—the oracle really meant
that many died because they married too young; it had nothing to do
with the ingathering of the harvest. It also conduces to temperance not
to marry too soon; for women who marry early are apt to be wanton;
and in men too the bodily frame is stunted if they marry while the seed is
growing (for there is a time when the growth of the seed, also, ceases, or
continues to but a slight extent). Women should marry when they are
about eighteen years of age, and men at seven and thirty; then they are
in the prime of life, and the decline in the powers of both will coincide.
Further, the children, if their birth takes place soon, as may reasonably
be expected, will succeed in the beginning of their prime, when the fathers are already in the decline of life, and have nearly reached their
term of three-score years and ten.
Thus much of the age proper for marriage: the season of the year
should also be considered; according to our present custom, people generally limit marriage to the season of winter, and they are right. The
precepts of physicians and natural philosophers about generation should
also be studied by the parents themselves; the physicians give good advice about the favorable conditions of the body, and the natural philosophers about the winds; of which they prefer the north to the south.
What constitution in the parent is most advantageous to the offspring is a subject which we will consider more carefully when we speak
of the education of children, and we will only make a few general remarks at present. The constitution of an athlete is not suited to the life of
a citizen, or to health, or to the procreation of children, any more than
the valetudinarian or exhausted constitution, but one which is in a mean
between them. A man’s constitution should be inured to labor, but not to
labor which is excessive or of one sort only, such as is practiced by
athletes; he should be capable of all the actions of a freeman. These
remarks apply equally to both parents.
178/Aristotle
Women who are with child should be careful of themselves; they
should take exercise and have a nourishing diet. The first of these prescriptions the legislator will easily carry into effect by requiring that
they shall take a walk daily to some temple, where they can worship the
gods who preside over birth. Their minds, however, unlike their bodies,
they ought to keep quiet, for the offspring derive their natures from their
mothers as plants do from the earth.
As to the exposure and rearing of children, let there be a law that no
deformed child shall live, but that on the ground of an excess in the
number of children, if the established customs of the state forbid this
(for in our state population has a limit), no child is to be exposed, but
when couples have children in excess, let abortion be procured before
sense and life have begun; what may or may not be lawfully done in
these cases depends on the question of life and sensation.
And now, having determined at what ages men and women are to
begin their union, let us also determine how long they shall continue to
beget and bear offspring for the state; men who are too old, like men
who are too young, produce children who are defective in body and
mind; the children of very old men are weakly. The limit then, should be
the age which is the prime of their intelligence, and this in most persons,
according to the notion of some poets who measure life by periods of
seven years, is about fifty; at four or five years or later, they should
cease from having families; and from that time forward only cohabit
with one another for the sake of health; or for some similar reason.
As to adultery, let it be held disgraceful, in general, for any man or
woman to be found in any way unfaithful when they are married, and
called husband and wife. If during the time of bearing children anything
of the sort occur, let the guilty person be punished with a loss of privileges in proportion to the offense.
Part XVII
After the children have been born, the manner of rearing them may be
supposed to have a great effect on their bodily strength. It would appear
from the example of animals, and of those nations who desire to create
the military habit, that the food which has most milk in it is best suited
to human beings; but the less wine the better, if they would escape diseases. Also all the motions to which children can be subjected at their
early age are very useful. But in order to preserve their tender limbs
from distortion, some nations have had recourse to mechanical appli-
Politics/179
ances which straighten their bodies. To accustom children to the cold
from their earliest years is also an excellent practice, which greatly
conduces to health, and hardens them for military service. Hence many
barbarians have a custom of plunging their children at birth into a cold
stream; others, like the Celts, clothe them in a light wrapper only. For
human nature should be early habituated to endure all which by habit it
can be made to endure; but the process must be gradual. And children,
from their natural warmth, may be easily trained to bear cold. Such care
should attend them in the first stage of life.
The next period lasts to the age of five; during this no demand should
be made upon the child for study or labor, lest its growth be impeded;
and there should be sufficient motion to prevent the limbs from being
inactive. This can be secured, among other ways, by amusement, but
the amusement should not be vulgar or tiring or effeminate. The Directors of Education, as they are termed, should be careful what tales or
stories the children hear, for all such things are designed to prepare the
way for the business of later life, and should be for the most part imitations of the occupations which they will hereafter pursue in earnest.
Those are wrong who in their laws attempt to check the loud crying and
screaming of children, for these contribute towards their growth, and, in
a manner, exercise their bodies. Straining the voice has a strengthening
effect similar to that produced by the retention of the breath in violent
exertions. The Directors of Education should have an eye to their bringing up, and in particular should take care that they are left as little as
possible with slaves. For until they are seven years old they must five at
home; and therefore, even at this early age, it is to be expected that they
should acquire a taint of meanness from what they hear and see. Indeed,
there is nothing which the legislator should be more careful to drive
away than indecency of speech; for the light utterance of shameful words
leads soon to shameful actions. The young especially should never be
allowed to repeat or hear anything of the sort. A freeman who is found
saying or doing what is forbidden, if he be too young as yet to have the
privilege of reclining at the public tables, should be disgraced and beaten,
and an elder person degraded as his slavish conduct deserves. And since
we do not allow improper language, clearly we should also banish pictures or speeches from the stage which are indecent. Let the rulers take
care that there be no image or picture representing unseemly actions,
except in the temples of those Gods at whose festivals the law permits
even ribaldry, and whom the law also permits to be worshipped by per-
180/Aristotle
sons of mature age on behalf of themselves, their children, and their
wives. But the legislator should not allow youth to be spectators of
iambi or of comedy until they are of an age to sit at the public tables and
to drink strong wine; by that time education will have armed them against
the evil influences of such representations.
We have made these remarks in a cursory manner—they are enough
for the present occasion; but hereafter we will return to the subject and
after a fuller discussion determine whether such liberty should or should
not be granted, and in what way granted, if at all. Theodorus, the tragic
actor, was quite right in saying that he would not allow any other actor,
not even if he were quite second-rate, to enter before himself, because
the spectators grew fond of the voices which they first heard. And the
same principle applies universally to association with things as well as
with persons, for we always like best whatever comes first. And therefore youth should be kept strangers to all that is bad, and especially to
things which suggest vice or hate. When the five years have passed
away, during the two following years they must look on at the pursuits
which they are hereafter to learn. There are two periods of life with
reference to which education has to be divided, from seven to the age of
puberty, and onwards to the age of one and twenty. The poets who divide ages by sevens are in the main right: but we should observe the
divisions actually made by nature; for the deficiencies of nature are
what art and education seek to fill up.
Let us then first inquire if any regulations are to be laid down about
children, and secondly, whether the care of them should be the concern
of the state or of private individuals, which latter is in our own day the
common custom, and in the third place, what these regulations should
be.
BOOK EIGHT
Part I
No one will doubt that the legislator should direct his attention above all
to the education of youth; for the neglect of education does harm to the
constitution The citizen should be molded to suit the form of government under which he lives. For each government has a peculiar character which originally formed and which continues to preserve it. The
character of democracy creates democracy, and the character of oligarchy creates oligarchy; and always the better the character, the better the
government.
Politics/181
Again, for the exercise of any faculty or art a previous training and
habituation are required; clearly therefore for the practice of virtue. And
since the whole city has one end, it is manifest that education should be
one and the same for all, and that it should be public, and not private—
not as at present, when every one looks after his own children separately, and gives them separate instruction of the sort which he thinks
best; the training in things which are of common interest should be the
same for all. Neither must we suppose that any one of the citizens belongs to himself, for they all belong to the state, and are each of them a
part of the state, and the care of each part is inseparable from the care of
the whole. In this particular as in some others the Lacedaemonians are
to be praised, for they take the greatest pains about their children, and
make education the business of the state.
Part II
That education should be regulated by law and should be an affair of
state is not to be denied, but what should be the character of this public
education, and how young persons should be educated, are questions
which remain to be considered. As things are, there is disagreement
about the subjects. For mankind are by no means agreed about the things
to be taught, whether we look to virtue or the best life. Neither is it clear
whether education is more concerned with intellectual or with moral
virtue. The existing practice is perplexing; no one knows on what principle we should proceed—should the useful in life, or should virtue, or
should the higher knowledge, be the aim of our training; all three opinions have been entertained. Again, about the means there is no agreement; for different persons, starting with different ideas about the nature of virtue, naturally disagree about the practice of it. There can be
no doubt that children should be taught those useful things which are
really necessary, but not all useful things; for occupations are divided
into liberal and illiberal; and to young children should be imparted only
such kinds of knowledge as will be useful to them without vulgarizing
them. And any occupation, art, or science, which makes the body or
soul or mind of the freeman less fit for the practice or exercise of virtue,
is vulgar; wherefore we call those arts vulgar which tend to deform the
body, and likewise all paid employments, for they absorb and degrade
the mind. There are also some liberal arts quite proper for a freeman to
acquire, but only in a certain degree, and if he attend to them too closely,
in order to attain perfection in them, the same evil effects will follow.
182/Aristotle
The object also which a man sets before him makes a great difference; if
he does or learns anything for his own sake or for the sake of his friends,
or with a view to excellence the action will not appear illiberal; but if
done for the sake of others, the very same action will be thought menial
and servile. The received subjects of instruction, as I have already remarked, are partly of a liberal and party of an illiberal character.
Part III
The customary branches of education are in number four; they are—(1)
reading and writing, (2) gymnastic exercises, (3) music, to which is
sometimes added (4) drawing. Of these, reading and writing and drawing are regarded as useful for the purposes of life in a variety of ways,
and gymnastic exercises are thought to infuse courage. concerning music a doubt may be raised—in our own day most men cultivate it for the
sake of pleasure, but originally it was included in education, because
nature herself, as has been often said, requires that we should be able,
not only to work well, but to use leisure well; for, as I must repeat once
again, the first principle of all action is leisure. Both are required, but
leisure is better than occupation and is its end; and therefore the question must be asked, what ought we to do when at leisure? Clearly we
ought not to be amusing ourselves, for then amusement would be the
end of life. But if this is inconceivable, and amusement is needed more
amid serious occupations than at other times (for he who is hard at work
has need of relaxation, and amusement gives relaxation, whereas occupation is always accompanied with exertion and effort), we should introduce amusements only at suitable times, and they should be our medicines, for the emotion which they create in the soul is a relaxation, and
from the pleasure we obtain rest. But leisure of itself gives pleasure and
happiness and enjoyment of life, which are experienced, not by the busy
man, but by those who have leisure. For he who is occupied has in view
some end which he has not attained; but happiness is an end, since all
men deem it to be accompanied with pleasure and not with pain. This
pleasure, however, is regarded differently by different persons, and varies according to the habit of individuals; the pleasure of the best man is
the best, and springs from the noblest sources. It is clear then that there
are branches of learning and education which we must study merely
with a view to leisure spent in intellectual activity, and these are to be
valued for their own sake; whereas those kinds of knowledge which are
useful in business are to be deemed necessary, and exist for the sake of
Politics/183
other things. And therefore our fathers admitted music into education,
not on the ground either of its necessity or utility, for it is not necessary,
nor indeed useful in the same manner as reading and writing, which are
useful in money-making, in the management of a household, in the acquisition of knowledge and in political life, nor like drawing, useful for
a more correct judgment of the works of artists, nor again like gymnastic, which gives health and strength; for neither of these is to be gained
from music. There remains, then, the use of music for intellectual enjoyment in leisure; which is in fact evidently the reason of its introduction,
this being one of the ways in which it is thought that a freeman should
pass his leisure; as Homer says,
“But he who alone should be called to the pleasant feast,”
and afterwards he speaks of others whom he describes as inviting
“The bard who would delight them all.”
And in another place Odysseus says there is no better way of passing life than when men’s hearts are merry and
“The banqueters in the hall, sitting in order, hear the voice of the
minstrel.”
It is evident, then, that there is a sort of education in which parents
should train their sons, not as being useful or necessary, but because it
is liberal or noble. Whether this is of one kind only, or of more than one,
and if so, what they are, and how they are to be imparted, must hereafter
be determined. Thus much we are now in a position to say, that the
ancients witness to us; for their opinion may be gathered from the fact
that music is one of the received and traditional branches of education.
Further, it is clear that children should be instructed in some useful
things—for example, in reading and writing—not only for their usefulness, but also because many other sorts of knowledge are acquired
through them. With a like view they may be taught drawing, not to
prevent their making mistakes in their own purchases, or in order that
they may not be imposed upon in the buying or selling of articles, but
perhaps rather because it makes them judges of the beauty of the human
form. To be always seeking after the useful does not become free and
184/Aristotle
exalted souls. Now it is clear that in education practice must be used
before theory, and the body be trained before the mind; and therefore
boys should be handed over to the trainer, who creates in them the roper
habit of body, and to the wrestling-master, who teaches them their exercises.
Part IV
Of those states which in our own day seem to take the greatest care of
children, some aim at producing in them an athletic habit, but they only
injure their forms and stunt their growth. Although the Lacedaemonians
have not fallen into this mistake, yet they brutalize their children by
laborious exercises which they think will make them courageous. But in
truth, as we have often repeated, education should not be exclusively, or
principally, directed to this end. And even if we suppose the
Lacedaemonians to be right in their end, they do not attain it. For among
barbarians and among animals courage is found associated, not with the
greatest ferocity, but with a gentle and lion like temper. There are many
races who are ready enough to kill and eat men, such as the Achaeans
and Heniochi, who both live about the Black Sea; and there are other
mainland tribes, as bad or worse, who all live by plunder, but have no
courage. It is notorious that the Lacedaemonians themselves, while they
alone were assiduous in their laborious drill, were superior to others,
but now they are beaten both in war and gymnastic exercises. For their
ancient superiority did not depend on their mode of training their youth,
but only on the circumstance that they trained them when their only
rivals did not. Hence we may infer that what is noble, not what is brutal,
should have the first place; no wolf or other wild animal will face a
really noble danger; such dangers are for the brave man. And parents
who devote their children to gymnastics while they neglect their necessary education, in reality vulgarize them; for they make them useful to
the art of statesmanship in one quality only, and even in this the argument proves them to be inferior to others. We should judge the
Lacedaemonians not from what they have been, but from what they are;
for now they have rivals who compete with their education; formerly
they had none.
It is an admitted principle, that gymnastic exercises should be employed in education, and that for children they should be of a lighter
kind, avoiding severe diet or painful toil, lest the growth of the body be
impaired. The evil of excessive training in early years is strikingly proved
Politics/185
by the example of the Olympic victors; for not more than two or three of
them have gained a prize both as boys and as men; their early training
and severe gymnastic exercises exhausted their constitutions. When
boyhood is over, three years should be spent in other studies; the period
of life which follows may then be devoted to hard exercise and strict
diet. Men ought not to labor at the same time with their minds and with
their bodies; for the two kinds of labor are opposed to one another; the
labor of the body impedes the mind, and the labor of the mind the body.
Part V
Concerning music there are some questions which we have already raised;
these we may now resume and carry further; and our remarks will serve
as a prelude to this or any other discussion of the subject. It is not easy
to determine the nature of music, or why any one should have a knowledge of it. Shall we say, for the sake of amusement and relaxation, like
sleep or drinking, which are not good in themselves, but are pleasant,
and at the same time ‘care to cease,’ as Euripides says? And for this end
men also appoint music, and make use of all three alike—sleep, drinking, music—to which some add dancing. Or shall we argue that music
conduces to virtue, on the ground that it can form our minds and habituate us to true pleasures as our bodies are made by gymnastic to be of a
certain character? Or shall we say that it contributes to the enjoyment of
leisure and mental cultivation, which is a third alternative? Now obviously youths are not to be instructed with a view to their amusement, for
learning is no amusement, but is accompanied with pain. Neither is
intellectual enjoyment suitable to boys of that age, for it is the end, and
that which is imperfect cannot attain the perfect or end. But perhaps it
may be said that boys learn music for the sake of the amusement which
they will have when they are grown up. If so, why should they learn
themselves, and not, like the Persian and Median kings, enjoy the pleasure and instruction which is derived from hearing others? (for surely
persons who have made music the business and profession of their lives
will be better performers than those who practice only long enough to
learn). If they must learn music, on the same principle they should learn
cookery, which is absurd. And even granting that music may form the
character, the objection still holds: why should we learn ourselves? Why
cannot we attain true pleasure and form a correct judgment from hearing others, like the Lacedaemonians?—for they, without learning music, nevertheless can correctly judge, as they say, of good and bad melo-
186/Aristotle
dies. Or again, if music should be used to promote cheerfulness and
refined intellectual enjoyment, the objection still remains—why should
we learn ourselves instead of enjoying the performances of others? We
may illustrate what we are saying by our conception of the Gods; for in
the poets Zeus does not himself sing or play on the lyre. Nay, we call
professional performers vulgar; no freeman would play or sing unless
he were intoxicated or in jest. But these matters may be left for the
present.
The first question is whether music is or is not to be a part of education. Of the three things mentioned in our discussion, which does it produce?—education or amusement or intellectual enjoyment, for it may
be reckoned under all three, and seems to share in the nature of all of
them. Amusement is for the sake of relaxation, and relaxation is of necessity sweet, for it is the remedy of pain caused by toil; and intellectual
enjoyment is universally acknowledged to contain an element not only
of the noble but of the pleasant, for happiness is made up of both. All
men agree that music is one of the pleasantest things, whether with or
without songs; as Musaeus says:
“Song to mortals of all things the sweetest.”
Hence and with good reason it is introduced into social gatherings
and entertainments, because it makes the hearts of men glad: so that on
this ground alone we may assume that the young ought to be trained in
it. For innocent pleasures are not only in harmony with the perfect end
of life, but they also provide relaxation. And whereas men rarely attain
the end, but often rest by the way and amuse themselves, not only with
a view to a further end, but also for the pleasure’s sake, it may be well at
times to let them find a refreshment in music. It sometimes happens that
men make amusement the end, for the end probably contains some element of pleasure, though not any ordinary or lower pleasure; but they
mistake the lower for the higher, and in seeking for the one find the
other, since every pleasure has a likeness to the end of action. For the
end is not eligible for the sake of any future good, nor do the pleasures
which we have described exist for the sake of any future good but of the
past, that is to say, they are the alleviation of past toils and pains. And
we may infer this to be the reason why men seek happiness from these
pleasures.
But music is pursued, not only as an alleviation of past toil, but also
Politics/187
as providing recreation. And who can say whether, having this use, it
may not also have a nobler one? In addition to this common pleasure,
felt and shared in by all (for the pleasure given by music is natural, and
therefore adapted to all ages and characters), may it not have also some
influence over the character and the soul? It must have such an influence if characters are affected by it. And that they are so affected is
proved in many ways, and not least by the power which the songs of
Olympus exercise; for beyond question they inspire enthusiasm, and
enthusiasm is an emotion of the ethical part of the soul. Besides, when
men hear imitations, even apart from the rhythms and tunes themselves,
their feelings move in sympathy. Since then music is a pleasure, and
virtue consists in rejoicing and loving and hating aright, there is clearly
nothing which we are so much concerned to acquire and to cultivate as
the power of forming right judgments, and of taking delight in good
dispositions and noble actions. Rhythm and melody supply imitations
of anger and gentleness, and also of courage and temperance, and of all
the qualities contrary to these, and of the other qualities of character,
which hardly fall short of the actual affections, as we know from our
own experience, for in listening to such strains our souls undergo a
change. The habit of feeling pleasure or pain at mere representations is
not far removed from the same feeling about realities; for example, if
any one delights in the sight of a statue for its beauty only, it necessarily
follows that the sight of the original will be pleasant to him. The objects
of no other sense, such as taste or touch, have any resemblance to moral
qualities; in visible objects there is only a little, for there are figures
which are of a moral character, but only to a slight extent, and all do not
participate in the feeling about them. Again, figures and colors are not
imitations, but signs, of moral habits, indications which the body gives
of states of feeling. The connection of them with morals is slight, but in
so far as there is any, young men should be taught to look, not at the
works of Pauson, but at those of Polygnotus, or any other painter or
sculptor who expresses moral ideas. On the other hand, even in mere
melodies there is an imitation of character, for the musical modes differ
essentially from one another, and those who hear them are differently
affected by each. Some of them make men sad and grave, like the socalled Mixolydian, others enfeeble the mind, like the relaxed modes,
another, again, produces a moderate and settled temper, which appears
to be the peculiar effect of the Dorian; the Phrygian inspires enthusiasm. The whole subject has been well treated by philosophical writers
188/Aristotle
on this branch of education, and they confirm their arguments by facts.
The same principles apply to rhythms; some have a character of rest,
others of motion, and of these latter again, some have a more vulgar,
others a nobler movement. Enough has been said to show that music has
a power of forming the character, and should therefore be introduced
into the education of the young. The study is suited to the stage of youth,
for young persons will not, if they can help, endure anything which is
not sweetened by pleasure, and music has a natural sweetness. There
seems to be in us a sort of affinity to musical modes and rhythms, which
makes some philosophers say that the soul is a tuning, others, that it
possesses tuning.
Part VI
And now we have to determine the question which has been already
raised, whether children should be themselves taught to sing and play or
not. Clearly there is a considerable difference made in the character by
the actual practice of the art. It is difficult, if not impossible, for those
who do not perform to be good judges of the performance of others.
Besides, children should have something to do, and the rattle of Archytas,
which people give to their children in order to amuse them and prevent
them from breaking anything in the house, was a capital invention, for a
young thing cannot be quiet. The rattle is a toy suited to the infant mind,
and education is a rattle or toy for children of a larger growth. We conclude then that they should be taught music in such a way as to become
not only critics but performers.
The question what is or is not suitable for different ages may be
easily answered; nor is there any difficulty in meeting the objection of
those who say that the study of music is vulgar. We reply (1) in the first
place, that they who are to be judges must also be performers, and that
they should begin to practice early, although when they are older they
may be spared the execution; they must have learned to appreciate what
is good and to delight in it, thanks to the knowledge which they acquired
in their youth. As to (2) the vulgarizing effect which music is supposed
to exercise, this is a question which we shall have no difficulty in determining, when we have considered to what extent freemen who are being
trained to political virtue should pursue the art, what melodies and what
rhythms they should be allowed to use, and what instruments should be
employed in teaching them to play; for even the instrument makes a
difference. The answer to the objection turns upon these distinctions;
Politics/189
for it is quite possible that certain methods of teaching and learning
music do really have a degrading effect. It is evident then that the learning of music ought not to impede the business of riper years, or to degrade the body or render it unfit for civil or military training, whether
for bodily exercises at the time or for later studies.
The right measure will be attained if students of music stop short of
the arts which are practiced in professional contests, and do not seek to
acquire those fantastic marvels of execution which are now the fashion
in such contests, and from these have passed into education. Let the
young practice even such music as we have prescribed, only until they
are able to feel delight in noble melodies and rhythms, and not merely in
that common part of music in which every slave or child and even some
animals find pleasure.
From these principles we may also infer what instruments should be
used. The flute, or any other instrument which requires great skill, as
for example the harp, ought not to be admitted into education, but only
such as will make intelligent students of music or of the other parts of
education. Besides, the flute is not an instrument which is expressive of
moral character; it is too exciting. The proper time for using it is when
the performance aims not at instruction, but at the relief of the passions.
And there is a further objection; the impediment which the flute presents
to the use of the voice detracts from its educational value. The ancients
therefore were right in forbidding the flute to youths and freemen, although they had once allowed it. For when their wealth gave them a
greater inclination to leisure, and they had loftier notions of excellence,
being also elated with their success, both before and after the Persian
War, with more zeal than discernment they pursued every kind of knowledge, and so they introduced the flute into education. At Lacedaemon
there was a choragus who led the chorus with a flute, and at Athens the
instrument became so popular that most freemen could play upon it.
The popularity is shown by the tablet which Thrasippus dedicated when
he furnished the chorus to Ecphantides. Later experience enabled men
to judge what was or was not really conducive to virtue, and they rejected both the flute and several other old-fashioned instruments, such
as the Lydian harp, the many-stringed lyre, the ‘heptagon,’ ‘triangle,’
‘sambuca,’ the like—which are intended only to give pleasure to the
hearer, and require extraordinary skill of hand. There is a meaning also
in the myth of the ancients, which tells how Athene invented the flute
and then threw it away. It was not a bad idea of theirs, that the Goddess
190/Aristotle
disliked the instrument because it made the face ugly; but with still more
reason may we say that she rejected it because the acquirement of fluteplaying contributes nothing to the mind, since to Athene we ascribe both
knowledge and art.
Thus then we reject the professional instruments and also the professional mode of education in music (and by professional we mean that
which is adopted in contests), for in this the performer practices the art,
not for the sake of his own improvement, but in order to give pleasure,
and that of a vulgar sort, to his hearers. For this reason the execution of
such music is not the part of a freeman but of a paid performer, and the
result is that the performers are vulgarized, for the end at which they
aim is bad. The vulgarity of the spectator tends to lower the character of
the music and therefore of the performers; they look to him—he makes
them what they are, and fashions even their bodies by the movements
which he expects them to exhibit.
Part VII
We have also to consider rhythms and modes, and their use in education. Shall we use them all or make a distinction? and shall the same
distinction be made for those who practice music with a view to education, or shall it be some other? Now we see that music is produced by
melody and rhythm, and we ought to know what influence these have
respectively on education, and whether we should prefer excellence in
melody or excellence in rhythm. But as the subject has been very well
treated by many musicians of the present day, and also by philosophers
who have had considerable experience of musical education, to these we
would refer the more exact student of the subject; we shall only speak of
it now after the manner of the legislator, stating the general principles.
We accept the division of melodies proposed by certain philosophers into ethical melodies, melodies of action, and passionate or inspiring melodies, each having, as they say, a mode corresponding to it. But
we maintain further that music should be studied, not for the sake of
one, but of many benefits, that is to say, with a view to (1) education, (2)
purgation (the word ‘purgation’ we use at present without explanation,
but when hereafter we speak of poetry, we will treat the subject with
more precision); music may also serve (3) for for enjoyment, for relaxation, and for recreation after exertion. It is clear, therefore, that all the
modes must be employed by us, but not all of them in the same manner.
In education the most ethical modes are to be preferred, but in listening
Politics/191
to the performances of others we may admit the modes of action and
passion also. For feelings such as pity and fear, or, again, enthusiasm,
exist very strongly in some souls, and have more or less influence over
all. Some persons fall into a religious frenzy, whom we see as a result of
the sacred melodies—when they have used the melodies that excite the
soul to mystic frenzy—restored as though they had found healing and
purgation. Those who are influenced by pity or fear, and every emotional nature, must have a like experience, and others in so far as each is
susceptible to such emotions, and all are in a manner purged and their
souls lightened and delighted. The purgative melodies likewise give an
innocent pleasure to mankind. Such are the modes and the melodies in
which those who perform music at the theater should be invited to compete. But since the spectators are of two kinds—the one free and educated, and the other a vulgar crowd composed of mechanics, laborers,
and the like—there ought to be contests and exhibitions instituted for
the relaxation of the second class also. And the music will correspond to
their minds; for as their minds are perverted from the natural state, so
there are perverted modes and highly strung and unnaturally colored
melodies. A man receives pleasure from what is natural to him, and
therefore professional musicians may be allowed to practice this lower
sort of music before an audience of a lower type. But, for the purposes
of education, as I have already said, those modes and melodies should
be employed which are ethical, such as the Dorian, as we said before;
though we may include any others which are approved by philosophers
who have had a musical education. The Socrates of the Republic is
wrong in retaining only the Phrygian mode along with the Dorian, and
the more so because he rejects the flute; for the Phrygian is to the modes
what the flute is to musical instruments—both of them are exciting and
emotional. Poetry proves this, for Bacchic frenzy and all similar emotions are most suitably expressed by the flute, and are better set to the
Phrygian than to any other mode. The dithyramb, for example, is acknowledged to be Phrygian, a fact of which the connoisseurs of music
offer many proofs, saying, among other things, that Philoxenus, having
attempted to compose his Mysians as a dithyramb in the Dorian mode,
found it impossible, and fell back by the very nature of things into the
more appropriate Phrygian. All men agree that the Dorian music is the
gravest and manliest. And whereas we say that the extremes should be
avoided and the mean followed, and whereas the Dorian is a mean between the other modes, it is evident that our youth should be taught the
192/Aristotle
Dorian music.
Two principles have to be kept in view, what is possible, what is
becoming: at these every man ought to aim. But even these are relative
to age; the old, who have lost their powers, cannot very well sing the
high-strung modes, and nature herself seems to suggest that their songs
should be of the more relaxed kind. Wherefore the musicians likewise
blame Socrates, and with justice, for rejecting the relaxed modes in education under the idea that they are intoxicating, not in the ordinary sense
of intoxication (for wine rather tends to excite men), but because they
have no strength in them. And so, with a view also to the time of life
when men begin to grow old, they ought to practice the gentler modes
and melodies as well as the others, and, further, any mode, such as the
Lydian above all others appears to be, which is suited to children of
tender age, and possesses the elements both of order and of education.
Thus it is clear that education should be based upon three principles—
the mean, the possible, the becoming, these three.

Nicomachean Ethics
By Aristotle


Translated by W. D. Ross

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK I

1 

Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit,
is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the good has rightly
been declared to be that at which all things aim. But a certain difference
is found among ends; some are activities, others are products apart
from the activities that produce them. Where there are ends apart
from the actions, it is the nature of the products to be better than
the activities. Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences,
their ends also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that
of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics
wealth. But where such arts fall under a single capacity- as bridle-making
and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under
the art of riding, and this and every military action under strategy,
in the same way other arts fall under yet others- in all of these
the ends of the master arts are to be preferred to all the subordinate
ends; for it is for the sake of the former that the latter are pursued.
It makes no difference whether the activities themselves are the ends
of the actions, or something else apart from the activities, as in
the case of the sciences just mentioned. 

2 

If, then, there is some end of the things we do, which we desire for
its own sake (everything else being desired for the sake of this),
and if we do not choose everything for the sake of something else
(for at that rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our
desire would be empty and vain), clearly this must be the good and
the chief good. Will not the knowledge of it, then, have a great influence
on life? Shall we not, like archers who have a mark to aim at, be
more likely to hit upon what is right? If so, we must try, in outline
at least, to determine what it is, and of which of the sciences or
capacities it is the object. It would seem to belong to the most authoritative
art and that which is most truly the master art. And politics appears
to be of this nature; for it is this that ordains which of the sciences
should be studied in a state, and which each class of citizens should
learn and up to what point they should learn them; and we see even
the most highly esteemed of capacities to fall under this, e.g. strategy,
economics, rhetoric; now, since politics uses the rest of the sciences,
and since, again, it legislates as to what we are to do and what we
are to abstain from, the end of this science must include those of
the others, so that this end must be the good for man. For even if
the end is the same for a single man and for a state, that of the
state seems at all events something greater and more complete whether
to attain or to preserve; though it is worth while to attain the end
merely for one man, it is finer and more godlike to attain it for
a nation or for city-states. These, then, are the ends at which our
inquiry aims, since it is political science, in one sense of that
term. 

3 

Our discussion will be adequate if it has as much clearness as the
subject-matter admits of, for precision is not to be sought for alike
in all discussions, any more than in all the products of the crafts.
Now fine and just actions, which political science investigates, admit
of much variety and fluctuation of opinion, so that they may be thought
to exist only by convention, and not by nature. And goods also give
rise to a similar fluctuation because they bring harm to many people;
for before now men have been undone by reason of their wealth, and
others by reason of their courage. We must be content, then, in speaking
of such subjects and with such premisses to indicate the truth roughly
and in outline, and in speaking about things which are only for the
most part true and with premisses of the same kind to reach conclusions
that are no better. In the same spirit, therefore, should each type
of statement be received; for it is the mark of an educated man to
look for precision in each class of things just so far as the nature
of the subject admits; it is evidently equally foolish to accept probable
reasoning from a mathematician and to demand from a rhetorician scientific
proofs. 

Now each man judges well the things he knows, and of these he is a
good judge. And so the man who has been educated in a subject is a
good judge of that subject, and the man who has received an all-round
education is a good judge in general. Hence a young man is not a proper
hearer of lectures on political science; for he is inexperienced in
the actions that occur in life, but its discussions start from these
and are about these; and, further, since he tends to follow his passions,
his study will be vain and unprofitable, because the end aimed at
is not knowledge but action. And it makes no difference whether he
is young in years or youthful in character; the defect does not depend
on time, but on his living, and pursuing each successive object, as
passion directs. For to such persons, as to the incontinent, knowledge
brings no profit; but to those who desire and act in accordance with
a rational principle knowledge about such matters will be of great
benefit. 

These remarks about the student, the sort of treatment to be expected,
and the purpose of the inquiry, may be taken as our preface.

4 

Let us resume our inquiry and state, in view of the fact that all
knowledge and every pursuit aims at some good, what it is that we
say political science aims at and what is the highest of all goods
achievable by action. Verbally there is very general agreement; for
both the general run of men and people of superior refinement say
that it is happiness, and identify living well and doing well with
being happy; but with regard to what happiness is they differ, and
the many do not give the same account as the wise. For the former
think it is some plain and obvious thing, like pleasure, wealth, or
honour; they differ, however, from one another- and often even the
same man identifies it with different things, with health when he
is ill, with wealth when he is poor; but, conscious of their ignorance,
they admire those who proclaim some great ideal that is above their
comprehension. Now some thought that apart from these many goods there
is another which is self-subsistent and causes the goodness of all
these as well. To examine all the opinions that have been held were
perhaps somewhat fruitless; enough to examine those that are most
prevalent or that seem to be arguable. 

Let us not fail to notice, however, that there is a difference between
arguments from and those to the first principles. For Plato, too,
was right in raising this question and asking, as he used to do, 'are
we on the way from or to the first principles?' There is a difference,
as there is in a race-course between the course from the judges to
the turning-point and the way back. For, while we must begin with
what is known, things are objects of knowledge in two senses- some
to us, some without qualification. Presumably, then, we must begin
with things known to us. Hence any one who is to listen intelligently
to lectures about what is noble and just, and generally, about the
subjects of political science must have been brought up in good habits.
For the fact is the starting-point, and if this is sufficiently plain
to him, he will not at the start need the reason as well; and the
man who has been well brought up has or can easily get startingpoints.
And as for him who neither has nor can get them, let him hear the
words of Hesiod: 

Far best is he who knows all things himself; 
Good, he that hearkens when men counsel right; 
But he who neither knows, nor lays to heart 
Another's wisdom, is a useless wight. 
5 

Let us, however, resume our discussion from the point at which we
digressed. To judge from the lives that men lead, most men, and men
of the most vulgar type, seem (not without some ground) to identify
the good, or happiness, with pleasure; which is the reason why they
love the life of enjoyment. For there are, we may say, three prominent
types of life- that just mentioned, the political, and thirdly the
contemplative life. Now the mass of mankind are evidently quite slavish
in their tastes, preferring a life suitable to beasts, but they get
some ground for their view from the fact that many of those in high
places share the tastes of Sardanapallus. A consideration of the prominent
types of life shows that people of superior refinement and of active
disposition identify happiness with honour; for this is, roughly speaking,
the end of the political life. But it seems too superficial to be
what we are looking for, since it is thought to depend on those who
bestow honour rather than on him who receives it, but the good we
divine to be something proper to a man and not easily taken from him.
Further, men seem to pursue honour in order that they may be assured
of their goodness; at least it is by men of practical wisdom that
they seek to be honoured, and among those who know them, and on the
ground of their virtue; clearly, then, according to them, at any rate,
virtue is better. And perhaps one might even suppose this to be, rather
than honour, the end of the political life. But even this appears
somewhat incomplete; for possession of virtue seems actually compatible
with being asleep, or with lifelong inactivity, and, further, with
the greatest sufferings and misfortunes; but a man who was living
so no one would call happy, unless he were maintaining a thesis at
all costs. But enough of this; for the subject has been sufficiently
treated even in the current discussions. Third comes the contemplative
life, which we shall consider later. 

The life of money-making is one undertaken under compulsion, and wealth
is evidently not the good we are seeking; for it is merely useful
and for the sake of something else. And so one might rather take the
aforenamed objects to be ends; for they are loved for themselves.
But it is evident that not even these are ends; yet many arguments
have been thrown away in support of them. Let us leave this subject,
then. 

6 

We had perhaps better consider the universal good and discuss thoroughly
what is meant by it, although such an inquiry is made an uphill one
by the fact that the Forms have been introduced by friends of our
own. Yet it would perhaps be thought to be better, indeed to be our
duty, for the sake of maintaining the truth even to destroy what touches
us closely, especially as we are philosophers or lovers of wisdom;
for, while both are dear, piety requires us to honour truth above
our friends. 

The men who introduced this doctrine did not posit Ideas of classes
within which they recognized priority and posteriority (which is the
reason why they did not maintain the existence of an Idea embracing
all numbers); but the term 'good' is used both in the category of
substance and in that of quality and in that of relation, and that
which is per se, i.e. substance, is prior in nature to the relative
(for the latter is like an off shoot and accident of being); so that
there could not be a common Idea set over all these goods. Further,
since 'good' has as many senses as 'being' (for it is predicated both
in the category of substance, as of God and of reason, and in quality,
i.e. of the virtues, and in quantity, i.e. of that which is moderate,
and in relation, i.e. of the useful, and in time, i.e. of the right
opportunity, and in place, i.e. of the right locality and the like),
clearly it cannot be something universally present in all cases and
single; for then it could not have been predicated in all the categories
but in one only. Further, since of the things answering to one Idea
there is one science, there would have been one science of all the
goods; but as it is there are many sciences even of the things that
fall under one category, e.g. of opportunity, for opportunity in war
is studied by strategics and in disease by medicine, and the moderate
in food is studied by medicine and in exercise by the science of gymnastics.
And one might ask the question, what in the world they mean by 'a
thing itself', is (as is the case) in 'man himself' and in a particular
man the account of man is one and the same. For in so far as they
are man, they will in no respect differ; and if this is so, neither
will 'good itself' and particular goods, in so far as they are good.
But again it will not be good any the more for being eternal, since
that which lasts long is no whiter than that which perishes in a day.
The Pythagoreans seem to give a more plausible account of the good,
when they place the one in the column of goods; and it is they that
Speusippus seems to have followed. 

But let us discuss these matters elsewhere; an objection to what we
have said, however, may be discerned in the fact that the Platonists
have not been speaking about all goods, and that the goods that are
pursued and loved for themselves are called good by reference to a
single Form, while those which tend to produce or to preserve these
somehow or to prevent their contraries are called so by reference
to these, and in a secondary sense. Clearly, then, goods must be spoken
of in two ways, and some must be good in themselves, the others by
reason of these. Let us separate, then, things good in themselves
from things useful, and consider whether the former are called good
by reference to a single Idea. What sort of goods would one call good
in themselves? Is it those that are pursued even when isolated from
others, such as intelligence, sight, and certain pleasures and honours?
Certainly, if we pursue these also for the sake of something else,
yet one would place them among things good in themselves. Or is nothing
other than the Idea of good good in itself? In that case the Form
will be empty. But if the things we have named are also things good
in themselves, the account of the good will have to appear as something
identical in them all, as that of whiteness is identical in snow and
in white lead. But of honour, wisdom, and pleasure, just in respect
of their goodness, the accounts are distinct and diverse. The good,
therefore, is not some common element answering to one Idea.

But what then do we mean by the good? It is surely not like the things
that only chance to have the same name. Are goods one, then, by being
derived from one good or by all contributing to one good, or are they
rather one by analogy? Certainly as sight is in the body, so is reason
in the soul, and so on in other cases. But perhaps these subjects
had better be dismissed for the present; for perfect precision about
them would be more appropriate to another branch of philosophy. And
similarly with regard to the Idea; even if there is some one good
which is universally predicable of goods or is capable of separate
and independent existence, clearly it could not be achieved or attained
by man; but we are now seeking something attainable. Perhaps, however,
some one might think it worth while to recognize this with a view
to the goods that are attainable and achievable; for having this as
a sort of pattern we shall know better the goods that are good for
us, and if we know them shall attain them. This argument has some
plausibility, but seems to clash with the procedure of the sciences;
for all of these, though they aim at some good and seek to supply
the deficiency of it, leave on one side the knowledge of the good.
Yet that all the exponents of the arts should be ignorant of, and
should not even seek, so great an aid is not probable. It is hard,
too, to see how a weaver or a carpenter will be benefited in regard
to his own craft by knowing this 'good itself', or how the man who
has viewed the Idea itself will be a better doctor or general thereby.
For a doctor seems not even to study health in this way, but the health
of man, or perhaps rather the health of a particular man; it is individuals
that he is healing. But enough of these topics. 

7 

Let us again return to the good we are seeking, and ask what it can
be. It seems different in different actions and arts; it is different
in medicine, in strategy, and in the other arts likewise. What then
is the good of each? Surely that for whose sake everything else is
done. In medicine this is health, in strategy victory, in architecture
a house, in any other sphere something else, and in every action and
pursuit the end; for it is for the sake of this that all men do whatever
else they do. Therefore, if there is an end for all that we do, this
will be the good achievable by action, and if there are more than
one, these will be the goods achievable by action. 

So the argument has by a different course reached the same point;
but we must try to state this even more clearly. Since there are evidently
more than one end, and we choose some of these (e.g. wealth, flutes,
and in general instruments) for the sake of something else, clearly
not all ends are final ends; but the chief good is evidently something
final. Therefore, if there is only one final end, this will be what
we are seeking, and if there are more than one, the most final of
these will be what we are seeking. Now we call that which is in itself
worthy of pursuit more final than that which is worthy of pursuit
for the sake of something else, and that which is never desirable
for the sake of something else more final than the things that are
desirable both in themselves and for the sake of that other thing,
and therefore we call final without qualification that which is always
desirable in itself and never for the sake of something else.

Now such a thing happiness, above all else, is held to be; for this
we choose always for self and never for the sake of something else,
but honour, pleasure, reason, and every virtue we choose indeed for
themselves (for if nothing resulted from them we should still choose
each of them), but we choose them also for the sake of happiness,
judging that by means of them we shall be happy. Happiness, on the
other hand, no one chooses for the sake of these, nor, in general,
for anything other than itself. 

From the point of view of self-sufficiency the same result seems to
follow; for the final good is thought to be self-sufficient. Now by
self-sufficient we do not mean that which is sufficient for a man
by himself, for one who lives a solitary life, but also for parents,
children, wife, and in general for his friends and fellow citizens,
since man is born for citizenship. But some limit must be set to this;
for if we extend our requirement to ancestors and descendants and
friends' friends we are in for an infinite series. Let us examine
this question, however, on another occasion; the self-sufficient we
now define as that which when isolated makes life desirable and lacking
in nothing; and such we think happiness to be; and further we think
it most desirable of all things, without being counted as one good
thing among others- if it were so counted it would clearly be made
more desirable by the addition of even the least of goods; for that
which is added becomes an excess of goods, and of goods the greater
is always more desirable. Happiness, then, is something final and
self-sufficient, and is the end of action. 

Presumably, however, to say that happiness is the chief good seems
a platitude, and a clearer account of what it is still desired. This
might perhaps be given, if we could first ascertain the function of
man. For just as for a flute-player, a sculptor, or an artist, and,
in general, for all things that have a function or activity, the good
and the 'well' is thought to reside in the function, so would it seem
to be for man, if he has a function. Have the carpenter, then, and
the tanner certain functions or activities, and has man none? Is he
born without a function? Or as eye, hand, foot, and in general each
of the parts evidently has a function, may one lay it down that man
similarly has a function apart from all these? What then can this
be? Life seems to be common even to plants, but we are seeking what
is peculiar to man. Let us exclude, therefore, the life of nutrition
and growth. Next there would be a life of perception, but it also
seems to be common even to the horse, the ox, and every animal. There
remains, then, an active life of the element that has a rational principle;
of this, one part has such a principle in the sense of being obedient
to one, the other in the sense of possessing one and exercising thought.
And, as 'life of the rational element' also has two meanings, we must
state that life in the sense of activity is what we mean; for this
seems to be the more proper sense of the term. Now if the function
of man is an activity of soul which follows or implies a rational
principle, and if we say 'so-and-so-and 'a good so-and-so' have a
function which is the same in kind, e.g. a lyre, and a good lyre-player,
and so without qualification in all cases, eminence in respect of
goodness being idded to the name of the function (for the function
of a lyre-player is to play the lyre, and that of a good lyre-player
is to do so well): if this is the case, and we state the function
of man to be a certain kind of life, and this to be an activity or
actions of the soul implying a rational principle, and the function
of a good man to be the good and noble performance of these, and if
any action is well performed when it is performed in accordance with
the appropriate excellence: if this is the case, human good turns
out to be activity of soul in accordance with virtue, and if there
are more than one virtue, in accordance with the best and most complete.

But we must add 'in a complete life.' For one swallow does not make
a summer, nor does one day; and so too one day, or a short time, does
not make a man blessed and happy. 

Let this serve as an outline of the good; for we must presumably first
sketch it roughly, and then later fill in the details. But it would
seem that any one is capable of carrying on and articulating what
has once been well outlined, and that time is a good discoverer or
partner in such a work; to which facts the advances of the arts are
due; for any one can add what is lacking. And we must also remember
what has been said before, and not look for precision in all things
alike, but in each class of things such precision as accords with
the subject-matter, and so much as is appropriate to the inquiry.
For a carpenter and a geometer investigate the right angle in different
ways; the former does so in so far as the right angle is useful for
his work, while the latter inquires what it is or what sort of thing
it is; for he is a spectator of the truth. We must act in the same
way, then, in all other matters as well, that our main task may not
be subordinated to minor questions. Nor must we demand the cause in
all matters alike; it is enough in some cases that the fact be well
established, as in the case of the first principles; the fact is the
primary thing or first principle. Now of first principles we see some
by induction, some by perception, some by a certain habituation, and
others too in other ways. But each set of principles we must try to
investigate in the natural way, and we must take pains to state them
definitely, since they have a great influence on what follows. For
the beginning is thought to be more than half of the whole, and many
of the questions we ask are cleared up by it. 

8 

We must consider it, however, in the light not only of our conclusion
and our premisses, but also of what is commonly said about it; for
with a true view all the data harmonize, but with a false one the
facts soon clash. Now goods have been divided into three classes,
and some are described as external, others as relating to soul or
to body; we call those that relate to soul most properly and truly
goods, and psychical actions and activities we class as relating to
soul. Therefore our account must be sound, at least according to this
view, which is an old one and agreed on by philosophers. It is correct
also in that we identify the end with certain actions and activities;
for thus it falls among goods of the soul and not among external goods.
Another belief which harmonizes with our account is that the happy
man lives well and does well; for we have practically defined happiness
as a sort of good life and good action. The characteristics that are
looked for in happiness seem also, all of them, to belong to what
we have defined happiness as being. For some identify happiness with
virtue, some with practical wisdom, others with a kind of philosophic
wisdom, others with these, or one of these, accompanied by pleasure
or not without pleasure; while others include also external prosperity.
Now some of these views have been held by many men and men of old,
others by a few eminent persons; and it is not probable that either
of these should be entirely mistaken, but rather that they should
be right in at least some one respect or even in most respects.

With those who identify happiness with virtue or some one virtue our
account is in harmony; for to virtue belongs virtuous activity. But
it makes, perhaps, no small difference whether we place the chief
good in possession or in use, in state of mind or in activity. For
the state of mind may exist without producing any good result, as
in a man who is asleep or in some other way quite inactive, but the
activity cannot; for one who has the activity will of necessity be
acting, and acting well. And as in the Olympic Games it is not the
most beautiful and the strongest that are crowned but those who compete
(for it is some of these that are victorious), so those who act win,
and rightly win, the noble and good things in life. 

Their life is also in itself pleasant. For pleasure is a state of
soul, and to each man that which he is said to be a lover of is pleasant;
e.g. not only is a horse pleasant to the lover of horses, and a spectacle
to the lover of sights, but also in the same way just acts are pleasant
to the lover of justice and in general virtuous acts to the lover
of virtue. Now for most men their pleasures are in conflict with one
another because these are not by nature pleasant, but the lovers of
what is noble find pleasant the things that are by nature pleasant;
and virtuous actions are such, so that these are pleasant for such
men as well as in their own nature. Their life, therefore, has no
further need of pleasure as a sort of adventitious charm, but has
its pleasure in itself. For, besides what we have said, the man who
does not rejoice in noble actions is not even good; since no one would
call a man just who did not enjoy acting justly, nor any man liberal
who did not enjoy liberal actions; and similarly in all other cases.
If this is so, virtuous actions must be in themselves pleasant. But
they are also good and noble, and have each of these attributes in
the highest degree, since the good man judges well about these attributes;
his judgement is such as we have described. Happiness then is the
best, noblest, and most pleasant thing in the world, and these attributes
are not severed as in the inscription at Delos- 

Most noble is that which is justest, and best is health;

But pleasantest is it to win what we love. 

For all these properties belong to the best activities; and these,
or one- the best- of these, we identify with happiness. 

Yet evidently, as we said, it needs the external goods as well; for
it is impossible, or not easy, to do noble acts without the proper
equipment. In many actions we use friends and riches and political
power as instruments; and there are some things the lack of which
takes the lustre from happiness, as good birth, goodly children, beauty;
for the man who is very ugly in appearance or ill-born or solitary
and childless is not very likely to be happy, and perhaps a man would
be still less likely if he had thoroughly bad children or friends
or had lost good children or friends by death. As we said, then, happiness
seems to need this sort of prosperity in addition; for which reason
some identify happiness with good fortune, though others identify
it with virtue. 

9 

For this reason also the question is asked, whether happiness is to
be acquired by learning or by habituation or some other sort of training,
or comes in virtue of some divine providence or again by chance. Now
if there is any gift of the gods to men, it is reasonable that happiness
should be god-given, and most surely god-given of all human things
inasmuch as it is the best. But this question would perhaps be more
appropriate to another inquiry; happiness seems, however, even if
it is not god-sent but comes as a result of virtue and some process
of learning or training, to be among the most godlike things; for
that which is the prize and end of virtue seems to be the best thing
in the world, and something godlike and blessed. 

It will also on this view be very generally shared; for all who are
not maimed as regards their potentiality for virtue may win it by
a certain kind of study and care. But if it is better to be happy
thus than by chance, it is reasonable that the facts should be so,
since everything that depends on the action of nature is by nature
as good as it can be, and similarly everything that depends on art
or any rational cause, and especially if it depends on the best of
all causes. To entrust to chance what is greatest and most noble would
be a very defective arrangement. 

The answer to the question we are asking is plain also from the definition
of happiness; for it has been said to be a virtuous activity of soul,
of a certain kind. Of the remaining goods, some must necessarily pre-exist
as conditions of happiness, and others are naturally co-operative
and useful as instruments. And this will be found to agree with what
we said at the outset; for we stated the end of political science
to be the best end, and political science spends most of its pains
on making the citizens to be of a certain character, viz. good and
capable of noble acts. 

It is natural, then, that we call neither ox nor horse nor any other
of the animals happy; for none of them is capable of sharing in such
activity. For this reason also a boy is not happy; for he is not yet
capable of such acts, owing to his age; and boys who are called happy
are being congratulated by reason of the hopes we have for them. For
there is required, as we said, not only complete virtue but also a
complete life, since many changes occur in life, and all manner of
chances, and the most prosperous may fall into great misfortunes in
old age, as is told of Priam in the Trojan Cycle; and one who has
experienced such chances and has ended wretchedly no one calls happy.

10 

Must no one at all, then, be called happy while he lives; must we,
as Solon says, see the end? Even if we are to lay down this doctrine,
is it also the case that a man is happy when he is dead? Or is not
this quite absurd, especially for us who say that happiness is an
activity? But if we do not call the dead man happy, and if Solon does
not mean this, but that one can then safely call a man blessed as
being at last beyond evils and misfortunes, this also affords matter
for discussion; for both evil and good are thought to exist for a
dead man, as much as for one who is alive but not aware of them; e.g.
honours and dishonours and the good or bad fortunes of children and
in general of descendants. And this also presents a problem; for though
a man has lived happily up to old age and has had a death worthy of
his life, many reverses may befall his descendants- some of them may
be good and attain the life they deserve, while with others the opposite
may be the case; and clearly too the degrees of relationship between
them and their ancestors may vary indefinitely. It would be odd, then,
if the dead man were to share in these changes and become at one time
happy, at another wretched; while it would also be odd if the fortunes
of the descendants did not for some time have some effect on the happiness
of their ancestors. 

But we must return to our first difficulty; for perhaps by a consideration
of it our present problem might be solved. Now if we must see the
end and only then call a man happy, not as being happy but as having
been so before, surely this is a paradox, that when he is happy the
attribute that belongs to him is not to be truly predicated of him
because we do not wish to call living men happy, on account of the
changes that may befall them, and because we have assumed happiness
to be something permanent and by no means easily changed, while a
single man may suffer many turns of fortune's wheel. For clearly if
we were to keep pace with his fortunes, we should often call the same
man happy and again wretched, making the happy man out to be chameleon
and insecurely based. Or is this keeping pace with his fortunes quite
wrong? Success or failure in life does not depend on these, but human
life, as we said, needs these as mere additions, while virtuous activities
or their opposites are what constitute happiness or the reverse.

The question we have now discussed confirms our definition. For no
function of man has so much permanence as virtuous activities (these
are thought to be more durable even than knowledge of the sciences),
and of these themselves the most valuable are more durable because
those who are happy spend their life most readily and most continuously
in these; for this seems to be the reason why we do not forget them.
The attribute in question, then, will belong to the happy man, and
he will be happy throughout his life; for always, or by preference
to everything else, he will be engaged in virtuous action and contemplation,
and he will bear the chances of life most nobly and altogether decorously,
if he is 'truly good' and 'foursquare beyond reproach'. 

Now many events happen by chance, and events differing in importance;
small pieces of good fortune or of its opposite clearly do not weigh
down the scales of life one way or the other, but a multitude of great
events if they turn out well will make life happier (for not only
are they themselves such as to add beauty to life, but the way a man
deals with them may be noble and good), while if they turn out ill
they crush and maim happiness; for they both bring pain with them
and hinder many activities. Yet even in these nobility shines through,
when a man bears with resignation many great misfortunes, not through
insensibility to pain but through nobility and greatness of soul.

If activities are, as we said, what gives life its character, no happy
man can become miserable; for he will never do the acts that are hateful
and mean. For the man who is truly good and wise, we think, bears
all the chances life becomingly and always makes the best of circumstances,
as a good general makes the best military use of the army at his command
and a good shoemaker makes the best shoes out of the hides that are
given him; and so with all other craftsmen. And if this is the case,
the happy man can never become miserable; though he will not reach
blessedness, if he meet with fortunes like those of Priam.

Nor, again, is he many-coloured and changeable; for neither will he
be moved from his happy state easily or by any ordinary misadventures,
but only by many great ones, nor, if he has had many great misadventures,
will he recover his happiness in a short time, but if at all, only
in a long and complete one in which he has attained many splendid
successes. 

When then should we not say that he is happy who is active in accordance
with complete virtue and is sufficiently equipped with external goods,
not for some chance period but throughout a complete life? Or must
we add 'and who is destined to live thus and die as befits his life'?
Certainly the future is obscure to us, while happiness, we claim,
is an end and something in every way final. If so, we shall call happy
those among living men in whom these conditions are, and are to be,
fulfilled- but happy men. So much for these questions. 

11 

That the fortunes of descendants and of all a man's friends should
not affect his happiness at all seems a very unfriendly doctrine,
and one opposed to the opinions men hold; but since the events that
happen are numerous and admit of all sorts of difference, and some
come more near to us and others less so, it seems a long- nay, an
infinite- task to discuss each in detail; a general outline will perhaps
suffice. If, then, as some of a man's own misadventures have a certain
weight and influence on life while others are, as it were, lighter,
so too there are differences among the misadventures of our friends
taken as a whole, and it makes a difference whether the various suffering
befall the living or the dead (much more even than whether lawless
and terrible deeds are presupposed in a tragedy or done on the stage),
this difference also must be taken into account; or rather, perhaps,
the fact that doubt is felt whether the dead share in any good or
evil. For it seems, from these considerations, that even if anything
whether good or evil penetrates to them, it must be something weak
and negligible, either in itself or for them, or if not, at least
it must be such in degree and kind as not to make happy those who
are not happy nor to take away their blessedness from those who are.
The good or bad fortunes of friends, then, seem to have some effects
on the dead, but effects of such a kind and degree as neither to make
the happy unhappy nor to produce any other change of the kind.

12 

These questions having been definitely answered, let us consider whether
happiness is among the things that are praised or rather among the
things that are prized; for clearly it is not to be placed among potentialities.
Everything that is praised seems to be praised because it is of a
certain kind and is related somehow to something else; for we praise
the just or brave man and in general both the good man and virtue
itself because of the actions and functions involved, and we praise
the strong man, the good runner, and so on, because he is of a certain
kind and is related in a certain way to something good and important.
This is clear also from the praises of the gods; for it seems absurd
that the gods should be referred to our standard, but this is done
because praise involves a reference, to something else. But if if
praise is for things such as we have described, clearly what applies
to the best things is not praise, but something greater and better,
as is indeed obvious; for what we do to the gods and the most godlike
of men is to call them blessed and happy. And so too with good things;
no one praises happiness as he does justice, but rather calls it blessed,
as being something more divine and better. 

Eudoxus also seems to have been right in his method of advocating
the supremacy of pleasure; he thought that the fact that, though a
good, it is not praised indicated it to be better than the things
that are praised, and that this is what God and the good are; for
by reference to these all other things are judged. Praise is appropriate
to virtue, for as a result of virtue men tend to do noble deeds, but
encomia are bestowed on acts, whether of the body or of the soul.
But perhaps nicety in these matters is more proper to those who have
made a study of encomia; to us it is clear from what has been said
that happiness is among the things that are prized and perfect. It
seems to be so also from the fact that it is a first principle; for
it is for the sake of this that we all do all that we do, and the
first principle and cause of goods is, we claim, something prized
and divine. 

13 

Since happiness is an activity of soul in accordance with perfect
virtue, we must consider the nature of virtue; for perhaps we shall
thus see better the nature of happiness. The true student of politics,
too, is thought to have studied virtue above all things; for he wishes
to make his fellow citizens good and obedient to the laws. As an example
of this we have the lawgivers of the Cretans and the Spartans, and
any others of the kind that there may have been. And if this inquiry
belongs to political science, clearly the pursuit of it will be in
accordance with our original plan. But clearly the virtue we must
study is human virtue; for the good we were seeking was human good
and the happiness human happiness. By human virtue we mean not that
of the body but that of the soul; and happiness also we call an activity
of soul. But if this is so, clearly the student of politics must know
somehow the facts about soul, as the man who is to heal the eyes or
the body as a whole must know about the eyes or the body; and all
the more since politics is more prized and better than medicine; but
even among doctors the best educated spend much labour on acquiring
knowledge of the body. The student of politics, then, must study the
soul, and must study it with these objects in view, and do so just
to the extent which is sufficient for the questions we are discussing;
for further precision is perhaps something more laborious than our
purposes require. 

Some things are said about it, adequately enough, even in the discussions
outside our school, and we must use these; e.g. that one element in
the soul is irrational and one has a rational principle. Whether these
are separated as the parts of the body or of anything divisible are,
or are distinct by definition but by nature inseparable, like convex
and concave in the circumference of a circle, does not affect the
present question. 

Of the irrational element one division seems to be widely distributed,
and vegetative in its nature, I mean that which causes nutrition and
growth; for it is this kind of power of the soul that one must assign
to all nurslings and to embryos, and this same power to fullgrown
creatures; this is more reasonable than to assign some different power
to them. Now the excellence of this seems to be common to all species
and not specifically human; for this part or faculty seems to function
most in sleep, while goodness and badness are least manifest in sleep
(whence comes the saying that the happy are not better off than the
wretched for half their lives; and this happens naturally enough,
since sleep is an inactivity of the soul in that respect in which
it is called good or bad), unless perhaps to a small extent some of
the movements actually penetrate to the soul, and in this respect
the dreams of good men are better than those of ordinary people. Enough
of this subject, however; let us leave the nutritive faculty alone,
since it has by its nature no share in human excellence.

There seems to be also another irrational element in the soul-one
which in a sense, however, shares in a rational principle. For we
praise the rational principle of the continent man and of the incontinent,
and the part of their soul that has such a principle, since it urges
them aright and towards the best objects; but there is found in them
also another element naturally opposed to the rational principle,
which fights against and resists that principle. For exactly as paralysed
limbs when we intend to move them to the right turn on the contrary
to the left, so is it with the soul; the impulses of incontinent people
move in contrary directions. But while in the body we see that which
moves astray, in the soul we do not. No doubt, however, we must none
the less suppose that in the soul too there is something contrary
to the rational principle, resisting and opposing it. In what sense
it is distinct from the other elements does not concern us. Now even
this seems to have a share in a rational principle, as we said; at
any rate in the continent man it obeys the rational principle and
presumably in the temperate and brave man it is still more obedient;
for in him it speaks, on all matters, with the same voice as the rational
principle. 

Therefore the irrational element also appears to be two-fold. For
the vegetative element in no way shares in a rational principle, but
the appetitive and in general the desiring element in a sense shares
in it, in so far as it listens to and obeys it; this is the sense
in which we speak of 'taking account' of one's father or one's friends,
not that in which we speak of 'accounting for a mathematical property.
That the irrational element is in some sense persuaded by a rational
principle is indicated also by the giving of advice and by all reproof
and exhortation. And if this element also must be said to have a rational
principle, that which has a rational principle (as well as that which
has not) will be twofold, one subdivision having it in the strict
sense and in itself, and the other having a tendency to obey as one
does one's father. 

Virtue too is distinguished into kinds in accordance with this difference;
for we say that some of the virtues are intellectual and others moral,
philosophic wisdom and understanding and practical wisdom being intellectual,
liberality and temperance moral. For in speaking about a man's character
we do not say that he is wise or has understanding but that he is
good-tempered or temperate; yet we praise the wise man also with respect
to his state of mind; and of states of mind we call those which merit
praise virtues. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK II

1 

Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual
virtue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teaching
(for which reason it requires experience and time), while moral virtue
comes about as a result of habit, whence also its name (ethike) is
one that is formed by a slight variation from the word ethos (habit).
From this it is also plain that none of the moral virtues arises in
us by nature; for nothing that exists by nature can form a habit contrary
to its nature. For instance the stone which by nature moves downwards
cannot be habituated to move upwards, not even if one tries to train
it by throwing it up ten thousand times; nor can fire be habituated
to move downwards, nor can anything else that by nature behaves in
one way be trained to behave in another. Neither by nature, then,
nor contrary to nature do the virtues arise in us; rather we are adapted
by nature to receive them, and are made perfect by habit.

Again, of all the things that come to us by nature we first acquire
the potentiality and later exhibit the activity (this is plain in
the case of the senses; for it was not by often seeing or often hearing
that we got these senses, but on the contrary we had them before we
used them, and did not come to have them by using them); but the virtues
we get by first exercising them, as also happens in the case of the
arts as well. For the things we have to learn before we can do them,
we learn by doing them, e.g. men become builders by building and lyreplayers
by playing the lyre; so too we become just by doing just acts, temperate
by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts. 

This is confirmed by what happens in states; for legislators make
the citizens good by forming habits in them, and this is the wish
of every legislator, and those who do not effect it miss their mark,
and it is in this that a good constitution differs from a bad one.

Again, it is from the same causes and by the same means that every
virtue is both produced and destroyed, and similarly every art; for
it is from playing the lyre that both good and bad lyre-players are
produced. And the corresponding statement is true of builders and
of all the rest; men will be good or bad builders as a result of building
well or badly. For if this were not so, there would have been no need
of a teacher, but all men would have been born good or bad at their
craft. This, then, is the case with the virtues also; by doing the
acts that we do in our transactions with other men we become just
or unjust, and by doing the acts that we do in the presence of danger,
and being habituated to feel fear or confidence, we become brave or
cowardly. The same is true of appetites and feelings of anger; some
men become temperate and good-tempered, others self-indulgent and
irascible, by behaving in one way or the other in the appropriate
circumstances. Thus, in one word, states of character arise out of
like activities. This is why the activities we exhibit must be of
a certain kind; it is because the states of character correspond to
the differences between these. It makes no small difference, then,
whether we form habits of one kind or of another from our very youth;
it makes a very great difference, or rather all the difference.

2 

Since, then, the present inquiry does not aim at theoretical knowledge
like the others (for we are inquiring not in order to know what virtue
is, but in order to become good, since otherwise our inquiry would
have been of no use), we must examine the nature of actions, namely
how we ought to do them; for these determine also the nature of the
states of character that are produced, as we have said. Now, that
we must act according to the right rule is a common principle and
must be assumed-it will be discussed later, i.e. both what the right
rule is, and how it is related to the other virtues. But this must
be agreed upon beforehand, that the whole account of matters of conduct
must be given in outline and not precisely, as we said at the very
beginning that the accounts we demand must be in accordance with the
subject-matter; matters concerned with conduct and questions of what
is good for us have no fixity, any more than matters of health. The
general account being of this nature, the account of particular cases
is yet more lacking in exactness; for they do not fall under any art
or precept but the agents themselves must in each case consider what
is appropriate to the occasion, as happens also in the art of medicine
or of navigation. 

But though our present account is of this nature we must give what
help we can. First, then, let us consider this, that it is the nature
of such things to be destroyed by defect and excess, as we see in
the case of strength and of health (for to gain light on things imperceptible
we must use the evidence of sensible things); both excessive and defective
exercise destroys the strength, and similarly drink or food which
is above or below a certain amount destroys the health, while that
which is proportionate both produces and increases and preserves it.
So too is it, then, in the case of temperance and courage and the
other virtues. For the man who flies from and fears everything and
does not stand his ground against anything becomes a coward, and the
man who fears nothing at all but goes to meet every danger becomes
rash; and similarly the man who indulges in every pleasure and abstains
from none becomes self-indulgent, while the man who shuns every pleasure,
as boors do, becomes in a way insensible; temperance and courage,
then, are destroyed by excess and defect, and preserved by the mean.

But not only are the sources and causes of their origination and growth
the same as those of their destruction, but also the sphere of their
actualization will be the same; for this is also true of the things
which are more evident to sense, e.g. of strength; it is produced
by taking much food and undergoing much exertion, and it is the strong
man that will be most able to do these things. So too is it with the
virtues; by abstaining from pleasures we become temperate, and it
is when we have become so that we are most able to abstain from them;
and similarly too in the case of courage; for by being habituated
to despise things that are terrible and to stand our ground against
them we become brave, and it is when we have become so that we shall
be most able to stand our ground against them. 

3 

We must take as a sign of states of character the pleasure or pain
that ensues on acts; for the man who abstains from bodily pleasures
and delights in this very fact is temperate, while the man who is
annoyed at it is self-indulgent, and he who stands his ground against
things that are terrible and delights in this or at least is not pained
is brave, while the man who is pained is a coward. For moral excellence
is concerned with pleasures and pains; it is on account of the pleasure
that we do bad things, and on account of the pain that we abstain
from noble ones. Hence we ought to have been brought up in a particular
way from our very youth, as Plato says, so as both to delight in and
to be pained by the things that we ought; for this is the right education.

Again, if the virtues are concerned with actions and passions, and
every passion and every action is accompanied by pleasure and pain,
for this reason also virtue will be concerned with pleasures and pains.
This is indicated also by the fact that punishment is inflicted by
these means; for it is a kind of cure, and it is the nature of cures
to be effected by contraries. 

Again, as we said but lately, every state of soul has a nature relative
to and concerned with the kind of things by which it tends to be made
worse or better; but it is by reason of pleasures and pains that men
become bad, by pursuing and avoiding these- either the pleasures and
pains they ought not or when they ought not or as they ought not,
or by going wrong in one of the other similar ways that may be distinguished.
Hence men even define the virtues as certain states of impassivity
and rest; not well, however, because they speak absolutely, and do
not say 'as one ought' and 'as one ought not' and 'when one ought
or ought not', and the other things that may be added. We assume,
then, that this kind of excellence tends to do what is best with regard
to pleasures and pains, and vice does the contrary. 

The following facts also may show us that virtue and vice are concerned
with these same things. There being three objects of choice and three
of avoidance, the noble, the advantageous, the pleasant, and their
contraries, the base, the injurious, the painful, about all of these
the good man tends to go right and the bad man to go wrong, and especially
about pleasure; for this is common to the animals, and also it accompanies
all objects of choice; for even the noble and the advantageous appear
pleasant. 

Again, it has grown up with us all from our infancy; this is why it
is difficult to rub off this passion, engrained as it is in our life.
And we measure even our actions, some of us more and others less,
by the rule of pleasure and pain. For this reason, then, our whole
inquiry must be about these; for to feel delight and pain rightly
or wrongly has no small effect on our actions. 

Again, it is harder to fight with pleasure than with anger, to use
Heraclitus' phrase', but both art and virtue are always concerned
with what is harder; for even the good is better when it is harder.
Therefore for this reason also the whole concern both of virtue and
of political science is with pleasures and pains; for the man who
uses these well will be good, he who uses them badly bad.

That virtue, then, is concerned with pleasures and pains, and that
by the acts from which it arises it is both increased and, if they
are done differently, destroyed, and that the acts from which it arose
are those in which it actualizes itself- let this be taken as said.

4 

The question might be asked,; what we mean by saying that we must
become just by doing just acts, and temperate by doing temperate acts;
for if men do just and temperate acts, they are already just and temperate,
exactly as, if they do what is in accordance with the laws of grammar
and of music, they are grammarians and musicians. 

Or is this not true even of the arts? It is possible to do something
that is in accordance with the laws of grammar, either by chance or
at the suggestion of another. A man will be a grammarian, then, only
when he has both done something grammatical and done it grammatically;
and this means doing it in accordance with the grammatical knowledge
in himself. 

Again, the case of the arts and that of the virtues are not similar;
for the products of the arts have their goodness in themselves, so
that it is enough that they should have a certain character, but if
the acts that are in accordance with the virtues have themselves a
certain character it does not follow that they are done justly or
temperately. The agent also must be in a certain condition when he
does them; in the first place he must have knowledge, secondly he
must choose the acts, and choose them for their own sakes, and thirdly
his action must proceed from a firm and unchangeable character. These
are not reckoned in as conditions of the possession of the arts, except
the bare knowledge; but as a condition of the possession of the virtues
knowledge has little or no weight, while the other conditions count
not for a little but for everything, i.e. the very conditions which
result from often doing just and temperate acts. 

Actions, then, are called just and temperate when they are such as
the just or the temperate man would do; but it is not the man who
does these that is just and temperate, but the man who also does them
as just and temperate men do them. It is well said, then, that it
is by doing just acts that the just man is produced, and by doing
temperate acts the temperate man; without doing these no one would
have even a prospect of becoming good. 

But most people do not do these, but take refuge in theory and think
they are being philosophers and will become good in this way, behaving
somewhat like patients who listen attentively to their doctors, but
do none of the things they are ordered to do. As the latter will not
be made well in body by such a course of treatment, the former will
not be made well in soul by such a course of philosophy.

5 

Next we must consider what virtue is. Since things that are found
in the soul are of three kinds- passions, faculties, states of character,
virtue must be one of these. By passions I mean appetite, anger, fear,
confidence, envy, joy, friendly feeling, hatred, longing, emulation,
pity, and in general the feelings that are accompanied by pleasure
or pain; by faculties the things in virtue of which we are said to
be capable of feeling these, e.g. of becoming angry or being pained
or feeling pity; by states of character the things in virtue of which
we stand well or badly with reference to the passions, e.g. with reference
to anger we stand badly if we feel it violently or too weakly, and
well if we feel it moderately; and similarly with reference to the
other passions. 

Now neither the virtues nor the vices are passions, because we are
not called good or bad on the ground of our passions, but are so called
on the ground of our virtues and our vices, and because we are neither
praised nor blamed for our passions (for the man who feels fear or
anger is not praised, nor is the man who simply feels anger blamed,
but the man who feels it in a certain way), but for our virtues and
our vices we are praised or blamed. 

Again, we feel anger and fear without choice, but the virtues are
modes of choice or involve choice. Further, in respect of the passions
we are said to be moved, but in respect of the virtues and the vices
we are said not to be moved but to be disposed in a particular way.

For these reasons also they are not faculties; for we are neither
called good nor bad, nor praised nor blamed, for the simple capacity
of feeling the passions; again, we have the faculties by nature, but
we are not made good or bad by nature; we have spoken of this before.
If, then, the virtues are neither passions nor faculties, all that
remains is that they should be states of character. 

Thus we have stated what virtue is in respect of its genus.

6 

We must, however, not only describe virtue as a state of character,
but also say what sort of state it is. We may remark, then, that every
virtue or excellence both brings into good condition the thing of
which it is the excellence and makes the work of that thing be done
well; e.g. the excellence of the eye makes both the eye and its work
good; for it is by the excellence of the eye that we see well. Similarly
the excellence of the horse makes a horse both good in itself and
good at running and at carrying its rider and at awaiting the attack
of the enemy. Therefore, if this is true in every case, the virtue
of man also will be the state of character which makes a man good
and which makes him do his own work well. 

How this is to happen we have stated already, but it will be made
plain also by the following consideration of the specific nature of
virtue. In everything that is continuous and divisible it is possible
to take more, less, or an equal amount, and that either in terms of
the thing itself or relatively to us; and the equal is an intermediate
between excess and defect. By the intermediate in the object I mean
that which is equidistant from each of the extremes, which is one
and the same for all men; by the intermediate relatively to us that
which is neither too much nor too little- and this is not one, nor
the same for all. For instance, if ten is many and two is few, six
is the intermediate, taken in terms of the object; for it exceeds
and is exceeded by an equal amount; this is intermediate according
to arithmetical proportion. But the intermediate relatively to us
is not to be taken so; if ten pounds are too much for a particular
person to eat and two too little, it does not follow that the trainer
will order six pounds; for this also is perhaps too much for the person
who is to take it, or too little- too little for Milo, too much for
the beginner in athletic exercises. The same is true of running and
wrestling. Thus a master of any art avoids excess and defect, but
seeks the intermediate and chooses this- the intermediate not in the
object but relatively to us. 

If it is thus, then, that every art does its work well- by looking
to the intermediate and judgling its works by this standard (so that
we often say of good works of art that it is not possible either to
take away or to add anything, implying that excess and defect destroy
the goodness of works of art, while the mean preserves it; and good
artists, as we say, look to this in their work), and if, further,
virtue is more exact and better than any art, as nature also is, then
virtue must have the quality of aiming at the intermediate. I mean
moral virtue; for it is this that is concerned with passions and actions,
and in these there is excess, defect, and the intermediate. For instance,
both fear and confidence and appetite and anger and pity and in general
pleasure and pain may be felt both too much and too little, and in
both cases not well; but to feel them at the right times, with reference
to the right objects, towards the right people, with the right motive,
and in the right way, is what is both intermediate and best, and this
is characteristic of virtue. Similarly with regard to actions also
there is excess, defect, and the intermediate. Now virtue is concerned
with passions and actions, in which excess is a form of failure, and
so is defect, while the intermediate is praised and is a form of success;
and being praised and being successful are both characteristics of
virtue. Therefore virtue is a kind of mean, since, as we have seen,
it aims at what is intermediate. 

Again, it is possible to fail in many ways (for evil belongs to the
class of the unlimited, as the Pythagoreans conjectured, and good
to that of the limited), while to succeed is possible only in one
way (for which reason also one is easy and the other difficult- to
miss the mark easy, to hit it difficult); for these reasons also,
then, excess and defect are characteristic of vice, and the mean of
virtue; 

For men are good in but one way, but bad in many. 

Virtue, then, is a state of character concerned with choice, lying
in a mean, i.e. the mean relative to us, this being determined by
a rational principle, and by that principle by which the man of practical
wisdom would determine it. Now it is a mean between two vices, that
which depends on excess and that which depends on defect; and again
it is a mean because the vices respectively fall short of or exceed
what is right in both passions and actions, while virtue both finds
and chooses that which is intermediate. Hence in respect of its substance
and the definition which states its essence virtue is a mean, with
regard to what is best and right an extreme. 

But not every action nor every passion admits of a mean; for some
have names that already imply badness, e.g. spite, shamelessness,
envy, and in the case of actions adultery, theft, murder; for all
of these and suchlike things imply by their names that they are themselves
bad, and not the excesses or deficiencies of them. It is not possible,
then, ever to be right with regard to them; one must always be wrong.
Nor does goodness or badness with regard to such things depend on
committing adultery with the right woman, at the right time, and in
the right way, but simply to do any of them is to go wrong. It would
be equally absurd, then, to expect that in unjust, cowardly, and voluptuous
action there should be a mean, an excess, and a deficiency; for at
that rate there would be a mean of excess and of deficiency, an excess
of excess, and a deficiency of deficiency. But as there is no excess
and deficiency of temperance and courage because what is intermediate
is in a sense an extreme, so too of the actions we have mentioned
there is no mean nor any excess and deficiency, but however they are
done they are wrong; for in general there is neither a mean of excess
and deficiency, nor excess and deficiency of a mean. 

7 

We must, however, not only make this general statement, but also apply
it to the individual facts. For among statements about conduct those
which are general apply more widely, but those which are particular
are more genuine, since conduct has to do with individual cases, and
our statements must harmonize with the facts in these cases. We may
take these cases from our table. With regard to feelings of fear and
confidence courage is the mean; of the people who exceed, he who exceeds
in fearlessness has no name (many of the states have no name), while
the man who exceeds in confidence is rash, and he who exceeds in fear
and falls short in confidence is a coward. With regard to pleasures
and pains- not all of them, and not so much with regard to the pains-
the mean is temperance, the excess self-indulgence. Persons deficient
with regard to the pleasures are not often found; hence such persons
also have received no name. But let us call them 'insensible'.

With regard to giving and taking of money the mean is liberality,
the excess and the defect prodigality and meanness. In these actions
people exceed and fall short in contrary ways; the prodigal exceeds
in spending and falls short in taking, while the mean man exceeds
in taking and falls short in spending. (At present we are giving a
mere outline or summary, and are satisfied with this; later these
states will be more exactly determined.) With regard to money there
are also other dispositions- a mean, magnificence (for the magnificent
man differs from the liberal man; the former deals with large sums,
the latter with small ones), an excess, tastelessness and vulgarity,
and a deficiency, niggardliness; these differ from the states opposed
to liberality, and the mode of their difference will be stated later.
With regard to honour and dishonour the mean is proper pride, the
excess is known as a sort of 'empty vanity', and the deficiency is
undue humility; and as we said liberality was related to magnificence,
differing from it by dealing with small sums, so there is a state
similarly related to proper pride, being concerned with small honours
while that is concerned with great. For it is possible to desire honour
as one ought, and more than one ought, and less, and the man who exceeds
in his desires is called ambitious, the man who falls short unambitious,
while the intermediate person has no name. The dispositions also are
nameless, except that that of the ambitious man is called ambition.
Hence the people who are at the extremes lay claim to the middle place;
and we ourselves sometimes call the intermediate person ambitious
and sometimes unambitious, and sometimes praise the ambitious man
and sometimes the unambitious. The reason of our doing this will be
stated in what follows; but now let us speak of the remaining states
according to the method which has been indicated. 

With regard to anger also there is an excess, a deficiency, and a
mean. Although they can scarcely be said to have names, yet since
we call the intermediate person good-tempered let us call the mean
good temper; of the persons at the extremes let the one who exceeds
be called irascible, and his vice irascibility, and the man who falls
short an inirascible sort of person, and the deficiency inirascibility.

There are also three other means, which have a certain likeness to
one another, but differ from one another: for they are all concerned
with intercourse in words and actions, but differ in that one is concerned
with truth in this sphere, the other two with pleasantness; and of
this one kind is exhibited in giving amusement, the other in all the
circumstances of life. We must therefore speak of these too, that
we may the better see that in all things the mean is praise-worthy,
and the extremes neither praiseworthy nor right, but worthy of blame.
Now most of these states also have no names, but we must try, as in
the other cases, to invent names ourselves so that we may be clear
and easy to follow. With regard to truth, then, the intermediate is
a truthful sort of person and the mean may be called truthfulness,
while the pretence which exaggerates is boastfulness and the person
characterized by it a boaster, and that which understates is mock
modesty and the person characterized by it mock-modest. With regard
to pleasantness in the giving of amusement the intermediate person
is ready-witted and the disposition ready wit, the excess is buffoonery
and the person characterized by it a buffoon, while the man who falls
short is a sort of boor and his state is boorishness. With regard
to the remaining kind of pleasantness, that which is exhibited in
life in general, the man who is pleasant in the right way is friendly
and the mean is friendliness, while the man who exceeds is an obsequious
person if he has no end in view, a flatterer if he is aiming at his
own advantage, and the man who falls short and is unpleasant in all
circumstances is a quarrelsome and surly sort of person.

There are also means in the passions and concerned with the passions;
since shame is not a virtue, and yet praise is extended to the modest
man. For even in these matters one man is said to be intermediate,
and another to exceed, as for instance the bashful man who is ashamed
of everything; while he who falls short or is not ashamed of anything
at all is shameless, and the intermediate person is modest. Righteous
indignation is a mean between envy and spite, and these states are
concerned with the pain and pleasure that are felt at the fortunes
of our neighbours; the man who is characterized by righteous indignation
is pained at undeserved good fortune, the envious man, going beyond
him, is pained at all good fortune, and the spiteful man falls so
far short of being pained that he even rejoices. But these states
there will be an opportunity of describing elsewhere; with regard
to justice, since it has not one simple meaning, we shall, after describing
the other states, distinguish its two kinds and say how each of them
is a mean; and similarly we shall treat also of the rational virtues.

8 

There are three kinds of disposition, then, two of them vices, involving
excess and deficiency respectively, and one a virtue, viz. the mean,
and all are in a sense opposed to all; for the extreme states are
contrary both to the intermediate state and to each other, and the
intermediate to the extremes; as the equal is greater relatively to
the less, less relatively to the greater, so the middle states are
excessive relatively to the deficiencies, deficient relatively to
the excesses, both in passions and in actions. For the brave man appears
rash relatively to the coward, and cowardly relatively to the rash
man; and similarly the temperate man appears self-indulgent relatively
to the insensible man, insensible relatively to the self-indulgent,
and the liberal man prodigal relatively to the mean man, mean relatively
to the prodigal. Hence also the people at the extremes push the intermediate
man each over to the other, and the brave man is called rash by the
coward, cowardly by the rash man, and correspondingly in the other
cases. 

These states being thus opposed to one another, the greatest contrariety
is that of the extremes to each other, rather than to the intermediate;
for these are further from each other than from the intermediate,
as the great is further from the small and the small from the great
than both are from the equal. Again, to the intermediate some extremes
show a certain likeness, as that of rashness to courage and that of
prodigality to liberality; but the extremes show the greatest unlikeness
to each other; now contraries are defined as the things that are furthest
from each other, so that things that are further apart are more contrary.

To the mean in some cases the deficiency, in some the excess is more
opposed; e.g. it is not rashness, which is an excess, but cowardice,
which is a deficiency, that is more opposed to courage, and not insensibility,
which is a deficiency, but self-indulgence, which is an excess, that
is more opposed to temperance. This happens from two reasons, one
being drawn from the thing itself; for because one extreme is nearer
and liker to the intermediate, we oppose not this but rather its contrary
to the intermediate. E.g. since rashness is thought liker and nearer
to courage, and cowardice more unlike, we oppose rather the latter
to courage; for things that are further from the intermediate are
thought more contrary to it. This, then, is one cause, drawn from
the thing itself; another is drawn from ourselves; for the things
to which we ourselves more naturally tend seem more contrary to the
intermediate. For instance, we ourselves tend more naturally to pleasures,
and hence are more easily carried away towards self-indulgence than
towards propriety. We describe as contrary to the mean, then, rather
the directions in which we more often go to great lengths; and therefore
self-indulgence, which is an excess, is the more contrary to temperance.

9 

That moral virtue is a mean, then, and in what sense it is so, and
that it is a mean between two vices, the one involving excess, the
other deficiency, and that it is such because its character is to
aim at what is intermediate in passions and in actions, has been sufficiently
stated. Hence also it is no easy task to be good. For in everything
it is no easy task to find the middle, e.g. to find the middle of
a circle is not for every one but for him who knows; so, too, any
one can get angry- that is easy- or give or spend money; but to do
this to the right person, to the right extent, at the right time,
with the right motive, and in the right way, that is not for every
one, nor is it easy; wherefore goodness is both rare and laudable
and noble. 

Hence he who aims at the intermediate must first depart from what
is the more contrary to it, as Calypso advises- 

Hold the ship out beyond that surf and spray. 

For of the extremes one is more erroneous, one less so; therefore,
since to hit the mean is hard in the extreme, we must as a second
best, as people say, take the least of the evils; and this will be
done best in the way we describe. But we must consider the things
towards which we ourselves also are easily carried away; for some
of us tend to one thing, some to another; and this will be recognizable
from the pleasure and the pain we feel. We must drag ourselves away
to the contrary extreme; for we shall get into the intermediate state
by drawing well away from error, as people do in straightening sticks
that are bent. 

Now in everything the pleasant or pleasure is most to be guarded against;
for we do not judge it impartially. We ought, then, to feel towards
pleasure as the elders of the people felt towards Helen, and in all
circumstances repeat their saying; for if we dismiss pleasure thus
we are less likely to go astray. It is by doing this, then, (to sum
the matter up) that we shall best be able to hit the mean.

But this is no doubt difficult, and especially in individual cases;
for or is not easy to determine both how and with whom and on what
provocation and how long one should be angry; for we too sometimes
praise those who fall short and call them good-tempered, but sometimes
we praise those who get angry and call them manly. The man, however,
who deviates little from goodness is not blamed, whether he do so
in the direction of the more or of the less, but only the man who
deviates more widely; for he does not fail to be noticed. But up to
what point and to what extent a man must deviate before he becomes
blameworthy it is not easy to determine by reasoning, any more than
anything else that is perceived by the senses; such things depend
on particular facts, and the decision rests with perception. So much,
then, is plain, that the intermediate state is in all things to be
praised, but that we must incline sometimes towards the excess, sometimes
towards the deficiency; for so shall we most easily hit the mean and
what is right.

BOOK III

1 

Since virtue is concerned with passions and actions, and on voluntary
passions and actions praise and blame are bestowed, on those that
are involuntary pardon, and sometimes also pity, to distinguish the
voluntary and the involuntary is presumably necessary for those who
are studying the nature of virtue, and useful also for legislators
with a view to the assigning both of honours and of punishments. Those
things, then, are thought-involuntary, which take place under compulsion
or owing to ignorance; and that is compulsory of which the moving
principle is outside, being a principle in which nothing is contributed
by the person who is acting or is feeling the passion, e.g. if he
were to be carried somewhere by a wind, or by men who had him in their
power. 

But with regard to the things that are done from fear of greater evils
or for some noble object (e.g. if a tyrant were to order one to do
something base, having one's parents and children in his power, and
if one did the action they were to be saved, but otherwise would be
put to death), it may be debated whether such actions are involuntary
or voluntary. Something of the sort happens also with regard to the
throwing of goods overboard in a storm; for in the abstract no one
throws goods away voluntarily, but on condition of its securing the
safety of himself and his crew any sensible man does so. Such actions,
then, are mixed, but are more like voluntary actions; for they are
worthy of choice at the time when they are done, and the end of an
action is relative to the occasion. Both the terms, then, 'voluntary'
and 'involuntary', must be used with reference to the moment of action.
Now the man acts voluntarily; for the principle that moves the instrumental
parts of the body in such actions is in him, and the things of which
the moving principle is in a man himself are in his power to do or
not to do. Such actions, therefore, are voluntary, but in the abstract
perhaps involuntary; for no one would choose any such act in itself.

For such actions men are sometimes even praised, when they endure
something base or painful in return for great and noble objects gained;
in the opposite case they are blamed, since to endure the greatest
indignities for no noble end or for a trifling end is the mark of
an inferior person. On some actions praise indeed is not bestowed,
but pardon is, when one does what he ought not under pressure which
overstrains human nature and which no one could withstand. But some
acts, perhaps, we cannot be forced to do, but ought rather to face
death after the most fearful sufferings; for the things that 'forced'
Euripides Alcmaeon to slay his mother seem absurd. It is difficult
sometimes to determine what should be chosen at what cost, and what
should be endured in return for what gain, and yet more difficult
to abide by our decisions; for as a rule what is expected is painful,
and what we are forced to do is base, whence praise and blame are
bestowed on those who have been compelled or have not. 

What sort of acts, then, should be called compulsory? We answer that
without qualification actions are so when the cause is in the external
circumstances and the agent contributes nothing. But the things that
in themselves are involuntary, but now and in return for these gains
are worthy of choice, and whose moving principle is in the agent,
are in themselves involuntary, but now and in return for these gains
voluntary. They are more like voluntary acts; for actions are in the
class of particulars, and the particular acts here are voluntary.
What sort of things are to be chosen, and in return for what, it is
not easy to state; for there are many differences in the particular
cases. 

But if some one were to say that pleasant and noble objects have a
compelling power, forcing us from without, all acts would be for him
compulsory; for it is for these objects that all men do everything
they do. And those who act under compulsion and unwillingly act with
pain, but those who do acts for their pleasantness and nobility do
them with pleasure; it is absurd to make external circumstances responsible,
and not oneself, as being easily caught by such attractions, and to
make oneself responsible for noble acts but the pleasant objects responsible
for base acts. The compulsory, then, seems to be that whose moving
principle is outside, the person compelled contributing nothing.

Everything that is done by reason of ignorance is not voluntary; it
is only what produces pain and repentance that is involuntary. For
the man who has done something owing to ignorance, and feels not the
least vexation at his action, has not acted voluntarily, since he
did not know what he was doing, nor yet involuntarily, since he is
not pained. Of people, then, who act by reason of ignorance he who
repents is thought an involuntary agent, and the man who does not
repent may, since he is different, be called a not voluntary agent;
for, since he differs from the other, it is better that he should
have a name of his own. 

Acting by reason of ignorance seems also to be different from acting
in ignorance; for the man who is drunk or in a rage is thought to
act as a result not of ignorance but of one of the causes mentioned,
yet not knowingly but in ignorance. 

Now every wicked man is ignorant of what he ought to do and what he
ought to abstain from, and it is by reason of error of this kind that
men become unjust and in general bad; but the term 'involuntary' tends
to be used not if a man is ignorant of what is to his advantage- for
it is not mistaken purpose that causes involuntary action (it leads
rather to wickedness), nor ignorance of the universal (for that men
are blamed), but ignorance of particulars, i.e. of the circumstances
of the action and the objects with which it is concerned. For it is
on these that both pity and pardon depend, since the person who is
ignorant of any of these acts involuntarily. 

Perhaps it is just as well, therefore, to determine their nature and
number. A man may be ignorant, then, of who he is, what he is doing,
what or whom he is acting on, and sometimes also what (e.g. what instrument)
he is doing it with, and to what end (e.g. he may think his act will
conduce to some one's safety), and how he is doing it (e.g. whether
gently or violently). Now of all of these no one could be ignorant
unless he were mad, and evidently also he could not be ignorant of
the agent; for how could he not know himself? But of what he is doing
a man might be ignorant, as for instance people say 'it slipped out
of their mouths as they were speaking', or 'they did not know it was
a secret', as Aeschylus said of the mysteries, or a man might say
he 'let it go off when he merely wanted to show its working', as the
man did with the catapult. Again, one might think one's son was an
enemy, as Merope did, or that a pointed spear had a button on it,
or that a stone was pumicestone; or one might give a man a draught
to save him, and really kill him; or one might want to touch a man,
as people do in sparring, and really wound him. The ignorance may
relate, then, to any of these things, i.e. of the circumstances of
the action, and the man who was ignorant of any of these is thought
to have acted involuntarily, and especially if he was ignorant on
the most important points; and these are thought to be the circumstances
of the action and its end. Further, the doing of an act that is called
involuntary in virtue of ignorance of this sort must be painful and
involve repentance. 

Since that which is done under compulsion or by reason of ignorance
is involuntary, the voluntary would seem to be that of which the moving
principle is in the agent himself, he being aware of the particular
circumstances of the action. Presumably acts done by reason of anger
or appetite are not rightly called involuntary. For in the first place,
on that showing none of the other animals will act voluntarily, nor
will children; and secondly, is it meant that we do not do voluntarily
any of the acts that are due to appetite or anger, or that we do the
noble acts voluntarily and the base acts involuntarily? Is not this
absurd, when one and the same thing is the cause? But it would surely
be odd to describe as involuntary the things one ought to desire;
and we ought both to be angry at certain things and to have an appetite
for certain things, e.g. for health and for learning. Also what is
involuntary is thought to be painful, but what is in accordance with
appetite is thought to be pleasant. Again, what is the difference
in respect of involuntariness between errors committed upon calculation
and those committed in anger? Both are to be avoided, but the irrational
passions are thought not less human than reason is, and therefore
also the actions which proceed from anger or appetite are the man's
actions. It would be odd, then, to treat them as involuntary.

2 

Both the voluntary and the involuntary having been delimited, we must
next discuss choice; for it is thought to be most closely bound up
with virtue and to discriminate characters better than actions do.

Choice, then, seems to be voluntary, but not the same thing as the
voluntary; the latter extends more widely. For both children and the
lower animals share in voluntary action, but not in choice, and acts
done on the spur of the moment we describe as voluntary, but not as
chosen. 

Those who say it is appetite or anger or wish or a kind of opinion
do not seem to be right. For choice is not common to irrational creatures
as well, but appetite and anger are. Again, the incontinent man acts
with appetite, but not with choice; while the continent man on the
contrary acts with choice, but not with appetite. Again, appetite
is contrary to choice, but not appetite to appetite. Again, appetite
relates to the pleasant and the painful, choice neither to the painful
nor to the pleasant. 

Still less is it anger; for acts due to anger are thought to be less
than any others objects of choice. 

But neither is it wish, though it seems near to it; for choice cannot
relate to impossibles, and if any one said he chose them he would
be thought silly; but there may be a wish even for impossibles, e.g.
for immortality. And wish may relate to things that could in no way
be brought about by one's own efforts, e.g. that a particular actor
or athlete should win in a competition; but no one chooses such things,
but only the things that he thinks could be brought about by his own
efforts. Again, wish relates rather to the end, choice to the means;
for instance, we wish to be healthy, but we choose the acts which
will make us healthy, and we wish to be happy and say we do, but we
cannot well say we choose to be so; for, in general, choice seems
to relate to the things that are in our own power. 

For this reason, too, it cannot be opinion; for opinion is thought
to relate to all kinds of things, no less to eternal things and impossible
things than to things in our own power; and it is distinguished by
its falsity or truth, not by its badness or goodness, while choice
is distinguished rather by these. 

Now with opinion in general perhaps no one even says it is identical.
But it is not identical even with any kind of opinion; for by choosing
what is good or bad we are men of a certain character, which we are
not by holding certain opinions. And we choose to get or avoid something
good or bad, but we have opinions about what a thing is or whom it
is good for or how it is good for him; we can hardly be said to opine
to get or avoid anything. And choice is praised for being related
to the right object rather than for being rightly related to it, opinion
for being truly related to its object. And we choose what we best
know to be good, but we opine what we do not quite know; and it is
not the same people that are thought to make the best choices and
to have the best opinions, but some are thought to have fairly good
opinions, but by reason of vice to choose what they should not. If
opinion precedes choice or accompanies it, that makes no difference;
for it is not this that we are considering, but whether it is identical
with some kind of opinion. 

What, then, or what kind of thing is it, since it is none of the things
we have mentioned? It seems to be voluntary, but not all that is voluntary
to be an object of choice. Is it, then, what has been decided on by
previous deliberation? At any rate choice involves a rational principle
and thought. Even the name seems to suggest that it is what is chosen
before other things. 

3 

Do we deliberate about everything, and is everything a possible subject
of deliberation, or is deliberation impossible about some things?
We ought presumably to call not what a fool or a madman would deliberate
about, but what a sensible man would deliberate about, a subject of
deliberation. Now about eternal things no one deliberates, e.g. about
the material universe or the incommensurability of the diagonal and
the side of a square. But no more do we deliberate about the things
that involve movement but always happen in the same way, whether of
necessity or by nature or from any other cause, e.g. the solstices
and the risings of the stars; nor about things that happen now in
one way, now in another, e.g. droughts and rains; nor about chance
events, like the finding of treasure. But we do not deliberate even
about all human affairs; for instance, no Spartan deliberates about
the best constitution for the Scythians. For none of these things
can be brought about by our own efforts. 

We deliberate about things that are in our power and can be done;
and these are in fact what is left. For nature, necessity, and chance
are thought to be causes, and also reason and everything that depends
on man. Now every class of men deliberates about the things that can
be done by their own efforts. And in the case of exact and self-contained
sciences there is no deliberation, e.g. about the letters of the alphabet
(for we have no doubt how they should be written); but the things
that are brought about by our own efforts, but not always in the same
way, are the things about which we deliberate, e.g. questions of medical
treatment or of money-making. And we do so more in the case of the
art of navigation than in that of gymnastics, inasmuch as it has been
less exactly worked out, and again about other things in the same
ratio, and more also in the case of the arts than in that of the sciences;
for we have more doubt about the former. Deliberation is concerned
with things that happen in a certain way for the most part, but in
which the event is obscure, and with things in which it is indeterminate.
We call in others to aid us in deliberation on important questions,
distrusting ourselves as not being equal to deciding. 

We deliberate not about ends but about means. For a doctor does not
deliberate whether he shall heal, nor an orator whether he shall persuade,
nor a statesman whether he shall produce law and order, nor does any
one else deliberate about his end. They assume the end and consider
how and by what means it is to be attained; and if it seems to be
produced by several means they consider by which it is most easily
and best produced, while if it is achieved by one only they consider
how it will be achieved by this and by what means this will be achieved,
till they come to the first cause, which in the order of discovery
is last. For the person who deliberates seems to investigate and analyse
in the way described as though he were analysing a geometrical construction
(not all investigation appears to be deliberation- for instance mathematical
investigations- but all deliberation is investigation), and what is
last in the order of analysis seems to be first in the order of becoming.
And if we come on an impossibility, we give up the search, e.g. if
we need money and this cannot be got; but if a thing appears possible
we try to do it. By 'possible' things I mean things that might be
brought about by our own efforts; and these in a sense include things
that can be brought about by the efforts of our friends, since the
moving principle is in ourselves. The subject of investigation is
sometimes the instruments, sometimes the use of them; and similarly
in the other cases- sometimes the means, sometimes the mode of using
it or the means of bringing it about. It seems, then, as has been
said, that man is a moving principle of actions; now deliberation
is about the things to be done by the agent himself, and actions are
for the sake of things other than themselves. For the end cannot be
a subject of deliberation, but only the means; nor indeed can the
particular facts be a subject of it, as whether this is bread or has
been baked as it should; for these are matters of perception. If we
are to be always deliberating, we shall have to go on to infinity.

The same thing is deliberated upon and is chosen, except that the
object of choice is already determinate, since it is that which has
been decided upon as a result of deliberation that is the object of
choice. For every one ceases to inquire how he is to act when he has
brought the moving principle back to himself and to the ruling part
of himself; for this is what chooses. This is plain also from the
ancient constitutions, which Homer represented; for the kings announced
their choices to the people. The object of choice being one of the
things in our own power which is desired after deliberation, choice
will be deliberate desire of things in our own power; for when we
have decided as a result of deliberation, we desire in accordance
with our deliberation. 

We may take it, then, that we have described choice in outline, and
stated the nature of its objects and the fact that it is concerned
with means. 

4 

That wish is for the end has already been stated; some think it is
for the good, others for the apparent good. Now those who say that
the good is the object of wish must admit in consequence that that
which the man who does not choose aright wishes for is not an object
of wish (for if it is to be so, it must also be good; but it was,
if it so happened, bad); while those who say the apparent good is
the object of wish must admit that there is no natural object of wish,
but only what seems good to each man. Now different things appear
good to different people, and, if it so happens, even contrary things.

If these consequences are unpleasing, are we to say that absolutely
and in truth the good is the object of wish, but for each person the
apparent good; that that which is in truth an object of wish is an
object of wish to the good man, while any chance thing may be so the
bad man, as in the case of bodies also the things that are in truth
wholesome are wholesome for bodies which are in good condition, while
for those that are diseased other things are wholesome- or bitter
or sweet or hot or heavy, and so on; since the good man judges each
class of things rightly, and in each the truth appears to him? For
each state of character has its own ideas of the noble and the pleasant,
and perhaps the good man differs from others most by seeing the truth
in each class of things, being as it were the norm and measure of
them. In most things the error seems to be due to pleasure; for it
appears a good when it is not. We therefore choose the pleasant as
a good, and avoid pain as an evil. 

5 

The end, then, being what we wish for, the means what we deliberate
about and choose, actions concerning means must be according to choice
and voluntary. Now the exercise of the virtues is concerned with means.
Therefore virtue also is in our own power, and so too vice. For where
it is in our power to act it is also in our power not to act, and
vice versa; so that, if to act, where this is noble, is in our power,
not to act, which will be base, will also be in our power, and if
not to act, where this is noble, is in our power, to act, which will
be base, will also be in our power. Now if it is in our power to do
noble or base acts, and likewise in our power not to do them, and
this was what being good or bad meant, then it is in our power to
be virtuous or vicious. 

The saying that 'no one is voluntarily wicked nor involuntarily happy'
seems to be partly false and partly true; for no one is involuntarily
happy, but wickedness is voluntary. Or else we shall have to dispute
what has just been said, at any rate, and deny that man is a moving
principle or begetter of his actions as of children. But if these
facts are evident and we cannot refer actions to moving principles
other than those in ourselves, the acts whose moving principles are
in us must themselves also be in our power and voluntary.

Witness seems to be borne to this both by individuals in their private
capacity and by legislators themselves; for these punish and take
vengeance on those who do wicked acts (unless they have acted under
compulsion or as a result of ignorance for which they are not themselves
responsible), while they honour those who do noble acts, as though
they meant to encourage the latter and deter the former. But no one
is encouraged to do the things that are neither in our power nor voluntary;
it is assumed that there is no gain in being persuaded not to be hot
or in pain or hungry or the like, since we shall experience these
feelings none the less. Indeed, we punish a man for his very ignorance,
if he is thought responsible for the ignorance, as when penalties
are doubled in the case of drunkenness; for the moving principle is
in the man himself, since he had the power of not getting drunk and
his getting drunk was the cause of his ignorance. And we punish those
who are ignorant of anything in the laws that they ought to know and
that is not difficult, and so too in the case of anything else that
they are thought to be ignorant of through carelessness; we assume
that it is in their power not to be ignorant, since they have the
power of taking care. 

But perhaps a man is the kind of man not to take care. Still they
are themselves by their slack lives responsible for becoming men of
that kind, and men make themselves responsible for being unjust or
self-indulgent, in the one case by cheating and in the other by spending
their time in drinking bouts and the like; for it is activities exercised
on particular objects that make the corresponding character. This
is plain from the case of people training for any contest or action;
they practise the activity the whole time. Now not to know that it
is from the exercise of activities on particular objects that states
of character are produced is the mark of a thoroughly senseless person.
Again, it is irrational to suppose that a man who acts unjustly does
not wish to be unjust or a man who acts self-indulgently to be self-indulgent.
But if without being ignorant a man does the things which will make
him unjust, he will be unjust voluntarily. Yet it does not follow
that if he wishes he will cease to be unjust and will be just. For
neither does the man who is ill become well on those terms. We may
suppose a case in which he is ill voluntarily, through living incontinently
and disobeying his doctors. In that case it was then open to him not
to be ill, but not now, when he has thrown away his chance, just as
when you have let a stone go it is too late to recover it; but yet
it was in your power to throw it, since the moving principle was in
you. So, too, to the unjust and to the self-indulgent man it was open
at the beginning not to become men of this kind, and so they are unjust
and selfindulgent voluntarily; but now that they have become so it
is not possible for them not to be so. 

But not only are the vices of the soul voluntary, but those of the
body also for some men, whom we accordingly blame; while no one blames
those who are ugly by nature, we blame those who are so owing to want
of exercise and care. So it is, too, with respect to weakness and
infirmity; no one would reproach a man blind from birth or by disease
or from a blow, but rather pity him, while every one would blame a
man who was blind from drunkenness or some other form of self-indulgence.
Of vices of the body, then, those in our own power are blamed, those
not in our power are not. And if this be so, in the other cases also
the vices that are blamed must be in our own power. 

Now some one may say that all men desire the apparent good, but have
no control over the appearance, but the end appears to each man in
a form answering to his character. We reply that if each man is somehow
responsible for his state of mind, he will also be himself somehow
responsible for the appearance; but if not, no one is responsible
for his own evildoing, but every one does evil acts through ignorance
of the end, thinking that by these he will get what is best, and the
aiming at the end is not self-chosen but one must be born with an
eye, as it were, by which to judge rightly and choose what is truly
good, and he is well endowed by nature who is well endowed with this.
For it is what is greatest and most noble, and what we cannot get
or learn from another, but must have just such as it was when given
us at birth, and to be well and nobly endowed with this will be perfect
and true excellence of natural endowment. If this is true, then, how
will virtue be more voluntary than vice? To both men alike, the good
and the bad, the end appears and is fixed by nature or however it
may be, and it is by referring everything else to this that men do
whatever they do. 

Whether, then, it is not by nature that the end appears to each man
such as it does appear, but something also depends on him, or the
end is natural but because the good man adopts the means voluntarily
virtue is voluntary, vice also will be none the less voluntary; for
in the case of the bad man there is equally present that which depends
on himself in his actions even if not in his end. If, then, as is
asserted, the virtues are voluntary (for we are ourselves somehow
partly responsible for our states of character, and it is by being
persons of a certain kind that we assume the end to be so and so),
the vices also will be voluntary; for the same is true of them.

With regard to the virtues in general we have stated their genus in
outline, viz. that they are means and that they are states of character,
and that they tend, and by their own nature, to the doing of the acts
by which they are produced, and that they are in our power and voluntary,
and act as the right rule prescribes. But actions and states of character
are not voluntary in the same way; for we are masters of our actions
from the beginning right to the end, if we know the particular facts,
but though we control the beginning of our states of character the
gradual progress is not obvious any more than it is in illnesses;
because it was in our power, however, to act in this way or not in
this way, therefore the states are voluntary. 

Let us take up the several virtues, however, and say which they are
and what sort of things they are concerned with and how they are concerned
with them; at the same time it will become plain how many they are.
And first let us speak of courage. 

6 

That it is a mean with regard to feelings of fear and confidence has
already been made evident; and plainly the things we fear are terrible
things, and these are, to speak without qualification, evils; for
which reason people even define fear as expectation of evil. Now we
fear all evils, e.g. disgrace, poverty, disease, friendlessness, death,
but the brave man is not thought to be concerned with all; for to
fear some things is even right and noble, and it is base not to fear
them- e.g. disgrace; he who fears this is good and modest, and he
who does not is shameless. He is, however, by some people called brave,
by a transference of the word to a new meaning; for he has in him
something which is like the brave man, since the brave man also is
a fearless person. Poverty and disease we perhaps ought not to fear,
nor in general the things that do not proceed from vice and are not
due to a man himself. But not even the man who is fearless of these
is brave. Yet we apply the word to him also in virtue of a similarity;
for some who in the dangers of war are cowards are liberal and are
confident in face of the loss of money. Nor is a man a coward if he
fears insult to his wife and children or envy or anything of the kind;
nor brave if he is confident when he is about to be flogged. With
what sort of terrible things, then, is the brave man concerned? Surely
with the greatest; for no one is more likely than he to stand his
ground against what is awe-inspiring. Now death is the most terrible
of all things; for it is the end, and nothing is thought to be any
longer either good or bad for the dead. But the brave man would not
seem to be concerned even with death in all circumstances, e.g. at
sea or in disease. In what circumstances, then? Surely in the noblest.
Now such deaths are those in battle; for these take place in the greatest
and noblest danger. And these are correspondingly honoured in city-states
and at the courts of monarchs. Properly, then, he will be called brave
who is fearless in face of a noble death, and of all emergencies that
involve death; and the emergencies of war are in the highest degree
of this kind. Yet at sea also, and in disease, the brave man is fearless,
but not in the same way as the seaman; for he has given up hope of
safety, and is disliking the thought of death in this shape, while
they are hopeful because of their experience. At the same time, we
show courage in situations where there is the opportunity of showing
prowess or where death is noble; but in these forms of death neither
of these conditions is fulfilled. 

7 

What is terrible is not the same for all men; but we say there are
things terrible even beyond human strength. These, then, are terrible
to every one- at least to every sensible man; but the terrible things
that are not beyond human strength differ in magnitude and degree,
and so too do the things that inspire confidence. Now the brave man
is as dauntless as man may be. Therefore, while he will fear even
the things that are not beyond human strength, he will face them as
he ought and as the rule directs, for honour's sake; for this is the
end of virtue. But it is possible to fear these more, or less, and
again to fear things that are not terrible as if they were. Of the
faults that are committed one consists in fearing what one should
not, another in fearing as we should not, another in fearing when
we should not, and so on; and so too with respect to the things that
inspire confidence. The man, then, who faces and who fears the right
things and from the right motive, in the right way and from the right
time, and who feels confidence under the corresponding conditions,
is brave; for the brave man feels and acts according to the merits
of the case and in whatever way the rule directs. Now the end of every
activity is conformity to the corresponding state of character. This
is true, therefore, of the brave man as well as of others. But courage
is noble. Therefore the end also is noble; for each thing is defined
by its end. Therefore it is for a noble end that the brave man endures
and acts as courage directs. 

Of those who go to excess he who exceeds in fearlessness has no name
(we have said previously that many states of character have no names),
but he would be a sort of madman or insensible person if he feared
nothing, neither earthquakes nor the waves, as they say the Celts
do not; while the man who exceeds in confidence about what really
is terrible is rash. The rash man, however, is also thought to be
boastful and only a pretender to courage; at all events, as the brave
man is with regard to what is terrible, so the rash man wishes to
appear; and so he imitates him in situations where he can. Hence also
most of them are a mixture of rashness and cowardice; for, while in
these situations they display confidence, they do not hold their ground
against what is really terrible. The man who exceeds in fear is a
coward; for he fears both what he ought not and as he ought not, and
all the similar characterizations attach to him. He is lacking also
in confidence; but he is more conspicuous for his excess of fear in
painful situations. The coward, then, is a despairing sort of person;
for he fears everything. The brave man, on the other hand, has the
opposite disposition; for confidence is the mark of a hopeful disposition.
The coward, the rash man, and the brave man, then, are concerned with
the same objects but are differently disposed towards them; for the
first two exceed and fall short, while the third holds the middle,
which is the right, position; and rash men are precipitate, and wish
for dangers beforehand but draw back when they are in them, while
brave men are keen in the moment of action, but quiet beforehand.

As we have said, then, courage is a mean with respect to things that
inspire confidence or fear, in the circumstances that have been stated;
and it chooses or endures things because it is noble to do so, or
because it is base not to do so. But to die to escape from poverty
or love or anything painful is not the mark of a brave man, but rather
of a coward; for it is softness to fly from what is troublesome, and
such a man endures death not because it is noble but to fly from evil.

8 

Courage, then, is something of this sort, but the name is also applied
to five other kinds. 

First comes the courage of the citizen-soldier; for this is most like
true courage. Citizen-soldiers seem to face dangers because of the
penalties imposed by the laws and the reproaches they would otherwise
incur, and because of the honours they win by such action; and therefore
those peoples seem to be bravest among whom cowards are held in dishonour
and brave men in honour. This is the kind of courage that Homer depicts,
e.g. in Diomede and in Hector: 

First will Polydamas be to heap reproach on me then; and

For Hector one day 'mid the Trojans shall utter his vaulting

harangue: 
Afraid was Tydeides, and fled from my face. 

This kind of courage is most like to that which we described earlier,
because it is due to virtue; for it is due to shame and to desire
of a noble object (i.e. honour) and avoidance of disgrace, which is
ignoble. One might rank in the same class even those who are compelled
by their rulers; but they are inferior, inasmuch as they do what they
do not from shame but from fear, and to avoid not what is disgraceful
but what is painful; for their masters compel them, as Hector does:

But if I shall spy any dastard that cowers far from the fight,

Vainly will such an one hope to escape from the dogs. 

And those who give them their posts, and beat them if they retreat,
do the same, and so do those who draw them up with trenches or something
of the sort behind them; all of these apply compulsion. But one ought
to be brave not under compulsion but because it is noble to be so.

(2) Experience with regard to particular facts is also thought to
be courage; this is indeed the reason why Socrates thought courage
was knowledge. Other people exhibit this quality in other dangers,
and professional soldiers exhibit it in the dangers of war; for there
seem to be many empty alarms in war, of which these have had the most
comprehensive experience; therefore they seem brave, because the others
do not know the nature of the facts. Again, their experience makes
them most capable in attack and in defence, since they can use their
arms and have the kind that are likely to be best both for attack
and for defence; therefore they fight like armed men against unarmed
or like trained athletes against amateurs; for in such contests too
it is not the bravest men that fight best, but those who are strongest
and have their bodies in the best condition. Professional soldiers
turn cowards, however, when the danger puts too great a strain on
them and they are inferior in numbers and equipment; for they are
the first to fly, while citizen-forces die at their posts, as in fact
happened at the temple of Hermes. For to the latter flight is disgraceful
and death is preferable to safety on those terms; while the former
from the very beginning faced the danger on the assumption that they
were stronger, and when they know the facts they fly, fearing death
more than disgrace; but the brave man is not that sort of person.

(3) Passion also is sometimes reckoned as courage; those who act from
passion, like wild beasts rushing at those who have wounded them,
are thought to be brave, because brave men also are passionate; for
passion above all things is eager to rush on danger, and hence Homer's
'put strength into his passion' and 'aroused their spirit and passion
and 'hard he breathed panting' and 'his blood boiled'. For all such
expressions seem to indicate the stirring and onset of passion. Now
brave men act for honour's sake, but passion aids them; while wild
beasts act under the influence of pain; for they attack because they
have been wounded or because they are afraid, since if they are in
a forest they do not come near one. Thus they are not brave because,
driven by pain and passion, they rush on danger without foreseeing
any of the perils, since at that rate even asses would be brave when
they are hungry; for blows will not drive them from their food; and
lust also makes adulterers do many daring things. (Those creatures
are not brave, then, which are driven on to danger by pain or passion.)
The 'courage' that is due to passion seems to be the most natural,
and to be courage if choice and motive be added. 

Men, then, as well as beasts, suffer pain when they are angry, and
are pleased when they exact their revenge; those who fight for these
reasons, however, are pugnacious but not brave; for they do not act
for honour's sake nor as the rule directs, but from strength of feeling;
they have, however, something akin to courage. 

(4) Nor are sanguine people brave; for they are confident in danger
only because they have conquered often and against many foes. Yet
they closely resemble brave men, because both are confident; but brave
men are confident for the reasons stated earlier, while these are
so because they think they are the strongest and can suffer nothing.
(Drunken men also behave in this way; they become sanguine). When
their adventures do not succeed, however, they run away; but it was
the mark of a brave man to face things that are, and seem, terrible
for a man, because it is noble to do so and disgraceful not to do
so. Hence also it is thought the mark of a braver man to be fearless
and undisturbed in sudden alarms than to be so in those that are foreseen;
for it must have proceeded more from a state of character, because
less from preparation; acts that are foreseen may be chosen by calculation
and rule, but sudden actions must be in accordance with one's state
of character. 

(5) People who are ignorant of the danger also appear brave, and they
are not far removed from those of a sanguine temper, but are inferior
inasmuch as they have no self-reliance while these have. Hence also
the sanguine hold their ground for a time; but those who have been
deceived about the facts fly if they know or suspect that these are
different from what they supposed, as happened to the Argives when
they fell in with the Spartans and took them for Sicyonians.

We have, then, described the character both of brave men and of those
who are thought to be brave. 

9 

Though courage is concerned with feelings of confidence and of fear,
it is not concerned with both alike, but more with the things that
inspire fear; for he who is undisturbed in face of these and bears
himself as he should towards these is more truly brave than the man
who does so towards the things that inspire confidence. It is for
facing what is painful, then, as has been said, that men are called
brave. Hence also courage involves pain, and is justly praised; for
it is harder to face what is painful than to abstain from what is
pleasant. 

Yet the end which courage sets before it would seem to be pleasant,
but to be concealed by the attending circumstances, as happens also
in athletic contests; for the end at which boxers aim is pleasant-
the crown and the honours- but the blows they take are distressing
to flesh and blood, and painful, and so is their whole exertion; and
because the blows and the exertions are many the end, which is but
small, appears to have nothing pleasant in it. And so, if the case
of courage is similar, death and wounds will be painful to the brave
man and against his will, but he will face them because it is noble
to do so or because it is base not to do so. And the more he is possessed
of virtue in its entirety and the happier he is, the more he will
be pained at the thought of death; for life is best worth living for
such a man, and he is knowingly losing the greatest goods, and this
is painful. But he is none the less brave, and perhaps all the more
so, because he chooses noble deeds of war at that cost. It is not
the case, then, with all the virtues that the exercise of them is
pleasant, except in so far as it reaches its end. But it is quite
possible that the best soldiers may be not men of this sort but those
who are less brave but have no other good; for these are ready to
face danger, and they sell their life for trifling gains.

So much, then, for courage; it is not difficult to grasp its nature
in outline, at any rate, from what has been said. 

10 

After courage let us speak of temperance; for these seem to be the
virtues of the irrational parts. We have said that temperance is a
mean with regard to pleasures (for it is less, and not in the same
way, concerned with pains); self-indulgence also is manifested in
the same sphere. Now, therefore, let us determine with what sort of
pleasures they are concerned. We may assume the distinction between
bodily pleasures and those of the soul, such as love of honour and
love of learning; for the lover of each of these delights in that
of which he is a lover, the body being in no way affected, but rather
the mind; but men who are concerned with such pleasures are called
neither temperate nor self-indulgent. Nor, again, are those who are
concerned with the other pleasures that are not bodily; for those
who are fond of hearing and telling stories and who spend their days
on anything that turns up are called gossips, but not self-indulgent,
nor are those who are pained at the loss of money or of friends.

Temperance must be concerned with bodily pleasures, but not all even
of these; for those who delight in objects of vision, such as colours
and shapes and painting, are called neither temperate nor self-indulgent;
yet it would seem possible to delight even in these either as one
should or to excess or to a deficient degree. 

And so too is it with objects of hearing; no one calls those who delight
extravagantly in music or acting self-indulgent, nor those who do
so as they ought temperate. 

Nor do we apply these names to those who delight in odour, unless
it be incidentally; we do not call those self-indulgent who delight
in the odour of apples or roses or incense, but rather those who delight
in the odour of unguents or of dainty dishes; for self-indulgent people
delight in these because these remind them of the objects of their
appetite. And one may see even other people, when they are hungry,
delighting in the smell of food; but to delight in this kind of thing
is the mark of the self-indulgent man; for these are objects of appetite
to him. 

Nor is there in animals other than man any pleasure connected with
these senses, except incidentally. For dogs do not delight in the
scent of hares, but in the eating of them, but the scent told them
the hares were there; nor does the lion delight in the lowing of the
ox, but in eating it; but he perceived by the lowing that it was near,
and therefore appears to delight in the lowing; and similarly he does
not delight because he sees 'a stag or a wild goat', but because he
is going to make a meal of it. Temperance and self-indulgence, however,
are concerned with the kind of pleasures that the other animals share
in, which therefore appear slavish and brutish; these are touch and
taste. But even of taste they appear to make little or no use; for
the business of taste is the discriminating of flavours, which is
done by winetasters and people who season dishes; but they hardly
take pleasure in making these discriminations, or at least self-indulgent
people do not, but in the actual enjoyment, which in all cases comes
through touch, both in the case of food and in that of drink and in
that of sexual intercourse. This is why a certain gourmand prayed
that his throat might become longer than a crane's, implying that
it was the contact that he took pleasure in. Thus the sense with which
self-indulgence is connected is the most widely shared of the senses;
and self-indulgence would seem to be justly a matter of reproach,
because it attaches to us not as men but as animals. To delight in
such things, then, and to love them above all others, is brutish.
For even of the pleasures of touch the most liberal have been eliminated,
e.g. those produced in the gymnasium by rubbing and by the consequent
heat; for the contact characteristic of the self-indulgent man does
not affect the whole body but only certain parts. 

11 

Of the appetites some seem to be common, others to be peculiar to
individuals and acquired; e.g. the appetite for food is natural, since
every one who is without it craves for food or drink, and sometimes
for both, and for love also (as Homer says) if he is young and lusty;
but not every one craves for this or that kind of nourishment or love,
nor for the same things. Hence such craving appears to be our very
own. Yet it has of course something natural about it; for different
things are pleasant to different kinds of people, and some things
are more pleasant to every one than chance objects. Now in the natural
appetites few go wrong, and only in one direction, that of excess;
for to eat or drink whatever offers itself till one is surfeited is
to exceed the natural amount, since natural appetite is the replenishment
of one's deficiency. Hence these people are called belly-gods, this
implying that they fill their belly beyond what is right. It is people
of entirely slavish character that become like this. But with regard
to the pleasures peculiar to individuals many people go wrong and
in many ways. For while the people who are 'fond of so and so' are
so called because they delight either in the wrong things, or more
than most people do, or in the wrong way, the self-indulgent exceed
in all three ways; they both delight in some things that they ought
not to delight in (since they are hateful), and if one ought to delight
in some of the things they delight in, they do so more than one ought
and than most men do. 

Plainly, then, excess with regard to pleasures is self-indulgence
and is culpable; with regard to pains one is not, as in the case of
courage, called temperate for facing them or self-indulgent for not
doing so, but the selfindulgent man is so called because he is pained
more than he ought at not getting pleasant things (even his pain being
caused by pleasure), and the temperate man is so called because he
is not pained at the absence of what is pleasant and at his abstinence
from it. 

The self-indulgent man, then, craves for all pleasant things or those
that are most pleasant, and is led by his appetite to choose these
at the cost of everything else; hence he is pained both when he fails
to get them and when he is merely craving for them (for appetite involves
pain); but it seems absurd to be pained for the sake of pleasure.
People who fall short with regard to pleasures and delight in them
less than they should are hardly found; for such insensibility is
not human. Even the other animals distinguish different kinds of food
and enjoy some and not others; and if there is any one who finds nothing
pleasant and nothing more attractive than anything else, he must be
something quite different from a man; this sort of person has not
received a name because he hardly occurs. The temperate man occupies
a middle position with regard to these objects. For he neither enjoys
the things that the self-indulgent man enjoys most-but rather dislikes
them-nor in general the things that he should not, nor anything of
this sort to excess, nor does he feel pain or craving when they are
absent, or does so only to a moderate degree, and not more than he
should, nor when he should not, and so on; but the things that, being
pleasant, make for health or for good condition, he will desire moderately
and as he should, and also other pleasant things if they are not hindrances
to these ends, or contrary to what is noble, or beyond his means.
For he who neglects these conditions loves such pleasures more than
they are worth, but the temperate man is not that sort of person,
but the sort of person that the right rule prescribes. 

12 

Self-indulgence is more like a voluntary state than cowardice. For
the former is actuated by pleasure, the latter by pain, of which the
one is to be chosen and the other to be avoided; and pain upsets and
destroys the nature of the person who feels it, while pleasure does
nothing of the sort. Therefore self-indulgence is more voluntary.
Hence also it is more a matter of reproach; for it is easier to become
accustomed to its objects, since there are many things of this sort
in life, and the process of habituation to them is free from danger,
while with terrible objects the reverse is the case. But cowardice
would seem to be voluntary in a different degree from its particular
manifestations; for it is itself painless, but in these we are upset
by pain, so that we even throw down our arms and disgrace ourselves
in other ways; hence our acts are even thought to be done under compulsion.
For the self-indulgent man, on the other hand, the particular acts
are voluntary (for he does them with craving and desire), but the
whole state is less so; for no one craves to be self-indulgent.

The name self-indulgence is applied also to childish faults; for they
bear a certain resemblance to what we have been considering. Which
is called after which, makes no difference to our present purpose;
plainly, however, the later is called after the earlier. The transference
of the name seems not a bad one; for that which desires what is base
and which develops quickly ought to be kept in a chastened condition,
and these characteristics belong above all to appetite and to the
child, since children in fact live at the beck and call of appetite,
and it is in them that the desire for what is pleasant is strongest.
If, then, it is not going to be obedient and subject to the ruling
principle, it will go to great lengths; for in an irrational being
the desire for pleasure is insatiable even if it tries every source
of gratification, and the exercise of appetite increases its innate
force, and if appetites are strong and violent they even expel the
power of calculation. Hence they should be moderate and few, and should
in no way oppose the rational principle-and this is what we call an
obedient and chastened state-and as the child should live according
to the direction of his tutor, so the appetitive element should live
according to rational principle. Hence the appetitive element in a
temperate man should harmonize with the rational principle; for the
noble is the mark at which both aim, and the temperate man craves
for the things be ought, as he ought, as when he ought; and when he
ought; and this is what rational principle directs. 

Here we conclude our account of temperance. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK IV

1 

Let us speak next of liberality. It seems to be the mean with regard
to wealth; for the liberal man is praised not in respect of military
matters, nor of those in respect of which the temrate man is praised,
nor of judicial decisions, but with regard to the giving and taking
of wealth, and especially in respect of giving. Now by 'wealth' we
mean all the things whose value is measured by money. Further, prodigality
and meanness are excesses and defects with regard to wealth; and meanness
we always impute to those who care more than they ought for wealth,
but we sometimes apply the word 'prodigality' in a complex sense;
for we call those men prodigals who are incontinent and spend money
on self-indulgence. Hence also they are thought the poorest characters;
for they combine more vices than one. Therefore the application of
the word to them is not its proper use; for a 'prodigal' means a man
who has a single evil quality, that of wasting his substance; since
a prodigal is one who is being ruined by his own fault, and the wasting
of substance is thought to be a sort of ruining of oneself, life being
held to depend on possession of substance. 

This, then, is the sense in which we take the word 'prodigality'.
Now the things that have a use may be used either well or badly; and
riches is a useful thing; and everything is used best by the man who
has the virtue concerned with it; riches, therefore, will be used
best by the man who has the virtue concerned with wealth; and this
is the liberal man. Now spending and giving seem to be the using of
wealth; taking and keeping rather the possession of it. Hence it is
more the mark of the liberal man to give to the right people than
to take from the right sources and not to take from the wrong. For
it is more characteristic of virtue to do good than to have good done
to one, and more characteristic to do what is noble than not to do
what is base; and it is not hard to see that giving implies doing
good and doing what is noble, and taking implies having good done
to one or not acting basely. And gratitude is felt towards him who
gives, not towards him who does not take, and praise also is bestowed
more on him. It is easier, also, not to take than to give; for men
are apter to give away their own too little than to take what is another's.
Givers, too, are called liberal; but those who do not take are not
praised for liberality but rather for justice; while those who take
are hardly praised at all. And the liberal are almost the most loved
of all virtuous characters, since they are useful; and this depends
on their giving. 

Now virtuous actions are noble and done for the sake of the noble.
Therefore the liberal man, like other virtuous men, will give for
the sake of the noble, and rightly; for he will give to the right
people, the right amounts, and at the right time, with all the other
qualifications that accompany right giving; and that too with pleasure
or without pain; for that which is virtuous is pleasant or free from
pain-least of all will it be painful. But he who gives to the wrong
people or not for the sake of the noble but for some other cause,
will be called not liberal but by some other name. Nor is he liberal
who gives with pain; for he would prefer the wealth to the noble act,
and this is not characteristic of a liberal man. But no more will
the liberal man take from wrong sources; for such taking is not characteristic
of the man who sets no store by wealth. Nor will he be a ready asker;
for it is not characteristic of a man who confers benefits to accept
them lightly. But he will take from the right sources, e.g. from his
own possessions, not as something noble but as a necessity, that he
may have something to give. Nor will he neglect his own property,
since he wishes by means of this to help others. And he will refrain
from giving to anybody and everybody, that he may have something to
give to the right people, at the right time, and where it is noble
to do so. It is highly characteristic of a liberal man also to go
to excess in giving, so that he leaves too little for himself; for
it is the nature of a liberal man not to look to himself. The term
'liberality' is used relatively to a man's substance; for liberality
resides not in the multitude of the gifts but in the state of character
of the giver, and this is relative to the giver's substance. There
is therefore nothing to prevent the man who gives less from being
the more liberal man, if he has less to give those are thought to
be more liberal who have not made their wealth but inherited it; for
in the first place they have no experience of want, and secondly all
men are fonder of their own productions, as are parents and poets.
It is not easy for the liberal man to be rich, since he is not apt
either at taking or at keeping, but at giving away, and does not value
wealth for its own sake but as a means to giving. Hence comes the
charge that is brought against fortune, that those who deserve riches
most get it least. But it is not unreasonable that it should turn
out so; for he cannot have wealth, any more than anything else, if
he does not take pains to have it. Yet he will not give to the wrong
people nor at the wrong time, and so on; for he would no longer be
acting in accordance with liberality, and if he spent on these objects
he would have nothing to spend on the right objects. For, as has been
said, he is liberal who spends according to his substance and on the
right objects; and he who exceeds is prodigal. Hence we do not call
despots prodigal; for it is thought not easy for them to give and
spend beyond the amount of their possessions. Liberality, then, being
a mean with regard to giving and taking of wealth, the liberal man
will both give and spend the right amounts and on the right objects,
alike in small things and in great, and that with pleasure; he will
also take the right amounts and from the right sources. For, the virtue
being a mean with regard to both, he will do both as he ought; since
this sort of taking accompanies proper giving, and that which is not
of this sort is contrary to it, and accordingly the giving and taking
that accompany each other are present together in the same man, while
the contrary kinds evidently are not. But if he happens to spend in
a manner contrary to what is right and noble, he will be pained, but
moderately and as he ought; for it is the mark of virtue both to be
pleased and to be pained at the right objects and in the right way.
Further, the liberal man is easy to deal with in money matters; for
he can be got the better of, since he sets no store by money, and
is more annoyed if he has not spent something that he ought than pained
if he has spent something that he ought not, and does not agree with
the saying of Simonides. 

The prodigal errs in these respects also; for he is neither pleased
nor pained at the right things or in the right way; this will be more
evident as we go on. We have said that prodigality and meanness are
excesses and deficiencies, and in two things, in giving and in taking;
for we include spending under giving. Now prodigality exceeds in giving
and not taking, while meanness falls short in giving, and exceeds
in taking, except in small things. 

The characteristics of prodigality are not often combined; for it
is not easy to give to all if you take from none; private persons
soon exhaust their substance with giving, and it is to these that
the name of prodigals is applied- though a man of this sort would
seem to be in no small degree better than a mean man. For he is easily
cured both by age and by poverty, and thus he may move towards the
middle state. For he has the characteristics of the liberal man, since
he both gives and refrains from taking, though he does neither of
these in the right manner or well. Therefore if he were brought to
do so by habituation or in some other way, he would be liberal; for
he will then give to the right people, and will not take from the
wrong sources. This is why he is thought to have not a bad character;
it is not the mark of a wicked or ignoble man to go to excess in giving
and not taking, but only of a foolish one. The man who is prodigal
in this way is thought much better than the mean man both for the
aforesaid reasons and because he benefits many while the other benefits
no one, not even himself. 

But most prodigal people, as has been said, also take from the wrong
sources, and are in this respect mean. They become apt to take because
they wish to spend and cannot do this easily; for their possessions
soon run short. Thus they are forced to provide means from some other
source. At the same time, because they care nothing for honour, they
take recklessly and from any source; for they have an appetite for
giving, and they do not mind how or from what source. Hence also their
giving is not liberal; for it is not noble, nor does it aim at nobility,
nor is it done in the right way; sometimes they make rich those who
should be poor, and will give nothing to people of respectable character,
and much to flatterers or those who provide them with some other pleasure.
Hence also most of them are self-indulgent; for they spend lightly
and waste money on their indulgences, and incline towards pleasures
because they do not live with a view to what is noble. 

The prodigal man, then, turns into what we have described if he is
left untutored, but if he is treated with care he will arrive at the
intermediate and right state. But meanness is both incurable (for
old age and every disability is thought to make men mean) and more
innate in men than prodigality; for most men are fonder of getting
money than of giving. It also extends widely, and is multiform, since
there seem to be many kinds of meanness. 

For it consists in two things, deficiency in giving and excess in
taking, and is not found complete in all men but is sometimes divided;
some men go to excess in taking, others fall short in giving. Those
who are called by such names as 'miserly', 'close', 'stingy', all
fall short in giving, but do not covet the possessions of others nor
wish to get them. In some this is due to a sort of honesty and avoidance
of what is disgraceful (for some seem, or at least profess, to hoard
their money for this reason, that they may not some day be forced
to do something disgraceful; to this class belong the cheeseparer
and every one of the sort; he is so called from his excess of unwillingness
to give anything); while others again keep their hands off the property
of others from fear, on the ground that it is not easy, if one takes
the property of others oneself, to avoid having one's own taken by
them; they are therefore content neither to take nor to give.

Others again exceed in respect of taking by taking anything and from
any source, e.g. those who ply sordid trades, pimps and all such people,
and those who lend small sums and at high rates. For all of these
take more than they ought and from wrong sources. What is common to
them is evidently sordid love of gain; they all put up with a bad
name for the sake of gain, and little gain at that. For those who
make great gains but from wrong sources, and not the right gains,
e.g. despots when they sack cities and spoil temples, we do not call
mean but rather wicked, impious, and unjust. But the gamester and
the footpad (and the highwayman) belong to the class of the mean,
since they have a sordid love of gain. For it is for gain that both
of them ply their craft and endure the disgrace of it, and the one
faces the greatest dangers for the sake of the booty, while the other
makes gain from his friends, to whom he ought to be giving. Both,
then, since they are willing to make gain from wrong sources, are
sordid lovers of gain; therefore all such forms of taking are mean.

And it is natural that meanness is described as the contrary of liberality;
for not only is it a greater evil than prodigality, but men err more
often in this direction than in the way of prodigality as we have
described it. 

So much, then, for liberality and the opposed vices. 

2 

It would seem proper to discuss magnificence next. For this also seems
to be a virtue concerned with wealth; but it does not like liberality
extend to all the actions that are concerned with wealth, but only
to those that involve expenditure; and in these it surpasses liberality
in scale. For, as the name itself suggests, it is a fitting expenditure
involving largeness of scale. But the scale is relative; for the expense
of equipping a trireme is not the same as that of heading a sacred
embassy. It is what is fitting, then, in relation to the agent, and
to the circumstances and the object. The man who in small or middling
things spends according to the merits of the case is not called magnificent
(e.g. the man who can say 'many a gift I gave the wanderer'), but
only the man who does so in great things. For the magnificent man
is liberal, but the liberal man is not necessarily magnificent. The
deficiency of this state of character is called niggardliness, the
excess vulgarity, lack of taste, and the like, which do not go to
excess in the amount spent on right objects, but by showy expenditure
in the wrong circumstances and the wrong manner; we shall speak of
these vices later. 

The magnificent man is like an artist; for he can see what is fitting
and spend large sums tastefully. For, as we said at the begining,
a state of character is determined by its activities and by its objects.
Now the expenses of the magnificent man are large and fitting. Such,
therefore, are also his results; for thus there will be a great expenditure
and one that is fitting to its result. Therefore the result should
be worthy of the expense, and the expense should be worthy of the
result, or should even exceed it. And the magnificent man will spend
such sums for honour's sake; for this is common to the virtues. And
further he will do so gladly and lavishly; for nice calculation is
a niggardly thing. And he will consider how the result can be made
most beautiful and most becoming rather than for how much it can be
produced and how it can be produced most cheaply. It is necessary,
then, that the magnificent man be also liberal. For the liberal man
also will spend what he ought and as he ought; and it is in these
matters that the greatness implied in the name of the magnificent
man-his bigness, as it were-is manifested, since liberality is concerned
with these matters; and at an equal expense he will produce a more
magnificent work of art. For a possession and a work of art have not
the same excellence. The most valuable possession is that which is
worth most, e.g. gold, but the most valuable work of art is that which
is great and beautiful (for the contemplation of such a work inspires
admiration, and so does magnificence); and a work has an excellence-viz.
magnificence-which involves magnitude. Magnificence is an attribute
of expenditures of the kind which we call honourable, e.g. those connected
with the gods-votive offerings, buildings, and sacrifices-and similarly
with any form of religious worship, and all those that are proper
objects of public-spirited ambition, as when people think they ought
to equip a chorus or a trireme, or entertain the city, in a brilliant
way. But in all cases, as has been said, we have regard to the agent
as well and ask who he is and what means he has; for the expenditure
should be worthy of his means, and suit not only the result but also
the producer. Hence a poor man cannot be magnificent, since he has
not the means with which to spend large sums fittingly; and he who
tries is a fool, since he spends beyond what can be expected of him
and what is proper, but it is right expenditure that is virtuous.
But great expenditure is becoming to those who have suitable means
to start with, acquired by their own efforts or from ancestors or
connexions, and to people of high birth or reputation, and so on;
for all these things bring with them greatness and prestige. Primarily,
then, the magnificent man is of this sort, and magnificence is shown
in expenditures of this sort, as has been said; for these are the
greatest and most honourable. Of private occasions of expenditure
the most suitable are those that take place once for all, e.g. a wedding
or anything of the kind, or anything that interests the whole city
or the people of position in it, and also the receiving of foreign
guests and the sending of them on their way, and gifts and counter-gifts;
for the magnificent man spends not on himself but on public objects,
and gifts bear some resemblance to votive offerings. A magnificent
man will also furnish his house suitably to his wealth (for even a
house is a sort of public ornament), and will spend by preference
on those works that are lasting (for these are the most beautiful),
and on every class of things he will spend what is becoming; for the
same things are not suitable for gods and for men, nor in a temple
and in a tomb. And since each expenditure may be great of its kind,
and what is most magnificent absolutely is great expenditure on a
great object, but what is magnificent here is what is great in these
circumstances, and greatness in the work differs from greatness in
the expense (for the most beautiful ball or bottle is magnificent
as a gift to a child, but the price of it is small and mean),-therefore
it is characteristic of the magnificent man, whatever kind of result
he is producing, to produce it magnificently (for such a result is
not easily surpassed) and to make it worthy of the expenditure.

Such, then, is the magnificent man; the man who goes to excess and
is vulgar exceeds, as has been said, by spending beyond what is right.
For on small objects of expenditure he spends much and displays a
tasteless showiness; e.g. he gives a club dinner on the scale of a
wedding banquet, and when he provides the chorus for a comedy he brings
them on to the stage in purple, as they do at Megara. And all such
things he will do not for honour's sake but to show off his wealth,
and because he thinks he is admired for these things, and where he
ought to spend much he spends little and where little, much. The niggardly
man on the other hand will fall short in everything, and after spending
the greatest sums will spoil the beauty of the result for a trifle,
and whatever he is doing he will hesitate and consider how he may
spend least, and lament even that, and think he is doing everything
on a bigger scale than he ought. 

These states of character, then, are vices; yet they do not bring
disgrace because they are neither harmful to one's neighbour nor very
unseemly. 

3 

Pride seems even from its name to be concerned with great things;
what sort of great things, is the first question we must try to answer.
It makes no difference whether we consider the state of character
or the man characterized by it. Now the man is thought to be proud
who thinks himself worthy of great things, being worthy of them; for
he who does so beyond his deserts is a fool, but no virtuous man is
foolish or silly. The proud man, then, is the man we have described.
For he who is worthy of little and thinks himself worthy of little
is temperate, but not proud; for pride implies greatness, as beauty
implies a goodsized body, and little people may be neat and well-proportioned
but cannot be beautiful. On the other hand, he who thinks himself
worthy of great things, being unworthy of them, is vain; though not
every one who thinks himself worthy of more than he really is worthy
of in vain. The man who thinks himself worthy of worthy of less than
he is really worthy of is unduly humble, whether his deserts be great
or moderate, or his deserts be small but his claims yet smaller. And
the man whose deserts are great would seem most unduly humble; for
what would he have done if they had been less? The proud man, then,
is an extreme in respect of the greatness of his claims, but a mean
in respect of the rightness of them; for he claims what is accordance
with his merits, while the others go to excess or fall short.

If, then, he deserves and claims great things, and above all the great
things, he will be concerned with one thing in particular. Desert
is relative to external goods; and the greatest of these, we should
say, is that which we render to the gods, and which people of position
most aim at, and which is the prize appointed for the noblest deeds;
and this is honour; that is surely the greatest of external goods.
Honours and dishonours, therefore, are the objects with respect to
which the proud man is as he should be. And even apart from argument
it is with honour that proud men appear to be concerned; for it is
honour that they chiefly claim, but in accordance with their deserts.
The unduly humble man falls short both in comparison with his own
merits and in comparison with the proud man's claims. The vain man
goes to excess in comparison with his own merits, but does not exceed
the proud man's claims. 

Now the proud man, since he deserves most, must be good in the highest
degree; for the better man always deserves more, and the best man
most. Therefore the truly proud man must be good. And greatness in
every virtue would seem to be characteristic of a proud man. And it
would be most unbecoming for a proud man to fly from danger, swinging
his arms by his sides, or to wrong another; for to what end should
he do disgraceful acts, he to whom nothing is great? If we consider
him point by point we shall see the utter absurdity of a proud man
who is not good. Nor, again, would he be worthy of honour if he were
bad; for honour is the prize of virtue, and it is to the good that
it is rendered. Pride, then, seems to be a sort of crown of the virtues;
for it makes them greater, and it is not found without them. Therefore
it is hard to be truly proud; for it is impossible without nobility
and goodness of character. It is chiefly with honours and dishonours,
then, that the proud man is concerned; and at honours that are great
and conferred by good men he will be moderately Pleased, thinking
that he is coming by his own or even less than his own; for there
can be no honour that is worthy of perfect virtue, yet he will at
any rate accept it since they have nothing greater to bestow on him;
but honour from casual people and on trifling grounds he will utterly
despise, since it is not this that he deserves, and dishonour too,
since in his case it cannot be just. In the first place, then, as
has been said, the proud man is concerned with honours; yet he will
also bear himself with moderation towards wealth and power and all
good or evil fortune, whatever may befall him, and will be neither
over-joyed by good fortune nor over-pained by evil. For not even towards
honour does he bear himself as if it were a very great thing. Power
and wealth are desirable for the sake of honour (at least those who
have them wish to get honour by means of them); and for him to whom
even honour is a little thing the others must be so too. Hence proud
men are thought to be disdainful. 

The goods of fortune also are thought to contribute towards pride.
For men who are well-born are thought worthy of honour, and so are
those who enjoy power or wealth; for they are in a superior position,
and everything that has a superiority in something good is held in
greater honour. Hence even such things make men prouder; for they
are honoured by some for having them; but in truth the good man alone
is to be honoured; he, however, who has both advantages is thought
the more worthy of honour. But those who without virtue have such
goods are neither justified in making great claims nor entitled to
the name of 'proud'; for these things imply perfect virtue. Disdainful
and insolent, however, even those who have such goods become. For
without virtue it is not easy to bear gracefully the goods of fortune;
and, being unable to bear them, and thinking themselves superior to
others, they despise others and themselves do what they please. They
imitate the proud man without being like him, and this they do where
they can; so they do not act virtuously, but they do despise others.
For the proud man despises justly (since he thinks truly), but the
many do so at random. 

He does not run into trifling dangers, nor is he fond of danger, because
he honours few things; but he will face great dangers, and when he
is in danger he is unsparing of his life, knowing that there are conditions
on which life is not worth having. And he is the sort of man to confer
benefits, but he is ashamed of receiving them; for the one is the
mark of a superior, the other of an inferior. And he is apt to confer
greater benefits in return; for thus the original benefactor besides
being paid will incur a debt to him, and will be the gainer by the
transaction. They seem also to remember any service they have done,
but not those they have received (for he who receives a service is
inferior to him who has done it, but the proud man wishes to be superior),
and to hear of the former with pleasure, of the latter with displeasure;
this, it seems, is why Thetis did not mention to Zeus the services
she had done him, and why the Spartans did not recount their services
to the Athenians, but those they had received. It is a mark of the
proud man also to ask for nothing or scarcely anything, but to give
help readily, and to be dignified towards people who enjoy high position
and good fortune, but unassuming towards those of the middle class;
for it is a difficult and lofty thing to be superior to the former,
but easy to be so to the latter, and a lofty bearing over the former
is no mark of ill-breeding, but among humble people it is as vulgar
as a display of strength against the weak. Again, it is characteristic
of the proud man not to aim at the things commonly held in honour,
or the things in which others excel; to be sluggish and to hold back
except where great honour or a great work is at stake, and to be a
man of few deeds, but of great and notable ones. He must also be open
in his hate and in his love (for to conceal one's feelings, i.e. to
care less for truth than for what people will think, is a coward's
part), and must speak and act openly; for he is free of speech because
he is contemptuous, and he is given to telling the truth, except when
he speaks in irony to the vulgar. He must be unable to make his life
revolve round another, unless it be a friend; for this is slavish,
and for this reason all flatterers are servile and people lacking
in self-respect are flatterers. Nor is he given to admiration; for
nothing to him is great. Nor is he mindful of wrongs; for it is not
the part of a proud man to have a long memory, especially for wrongs,
but rather to overlook them. Nor is he a gossip; for he will speak
neither about himself nor about another, since he cares not to be
praised nor for others to be blamed; nor again is he given to praise;
and for the same reason he is not an evil-speaker, even about his
enemies, except from haughtiness. With regard to necessary or small
matters he is least of all me given to lamentation or the asking of
favours; for it is the part of one who takes such matters seriously
to behave so with respect to them. He is one who will possess beautiful
and profitless things rather than profitable and useful ones; for
this is more proper to a character that suffices to itself.

Further, a slow step is thought proper to the proud man, a deep voice,
and a level utterance; for the man who takes few things seriously
is not likely to be hurried, nor the man who thinks nothing great
to be excited, while a shrill voice and a rapid gait are the results
of hurry and excitement. 

Such, then, is the proud man; the man who falls short of him is unduly
humble, and the man who goes beyond him is vain. Now even these are
not thought to be bad (for they are not malicious), but only mistaken.
For the unduly humble man, being worthy of good things, robs himself
of what he deserves, and to have something bad about him from the
fact that he does not think himself worthy of good things, and seems
also not to know himself; else he would have desired the things he
was worthy of, since these were good. Yet such people are not thought
to be fools, but rather unduly retiring. Such a reputation, however,
seems actually to make them worse; for each class of people aims at
what corresponds to its worth, and these people stand back even from
noble actions and undertakings, deeming themselves unworthy, and from
external goods no less. Vain people, on the other hand, are fools
and ignorant of themselves, and that manifestly; for, not being worthy
of them, they attempt honourable undertakings, and then are found
out; and tetadorn themselves with clothing and outward show and such
things, and wish their strokes of good fortune to be made public,
and speak about them as if they would be honoured for them. But undue
humility is more opposed to pride than vanity is; for it is both commoner
and worse. 

Pride, then, is concerned with honour on the grand scale, as has been
said. 

4 

There seems to be in the sphere of honour also, as was said in our
first remarks on the subject, a virtue which would appear to be related
to pride as liberality is to magnificence. For neither of these has
anything to do with the grand scale, but both dispose us as is right
with regard to middling and unimportant objects; as in getting and
giving of wealth there is a mean and an excess and defect, so too
honour may be desired more than is right, or less, or from the right
sources and in the right way. We blame both the ambitious man as am
at honour more than is right and from wrong sources, and the unambitious
man as not willing to be honoured even for noble reasons. But sometimes
we praise the ambitious man as being manly and a lover of what is
noble, and the unambitious man as being moderate and self-controlled,
as we said in our first treatment of the subject. Evidently, since
'fond of such and such an object' has more than one meaning, we do
not assign the term 'ambition' or 'love of honour' always to the same
thing, but when we praise the quality we think of the man who loves
honour more than most people, and when we blame it we think of him
who loves it more than is right. The mean being without a name, the
extremes seem to dispute for its place as though that were vacant
by default. But where there is excess and defect, there is also an
intermediate; now men desire honour both more than they should and
less; therefore it is possible also to do so as one should; at all
events this is the state of character that is praised, being an unnamed
mean in respect of honour. Relatively to ambition it seems to be unambitiousness,
and relatively to unambitiousness it seems to be ambition, while relatively
to both severally it seems in a sense to be both together. This appears
to be true of the other virtues also. But in this case the extremes
seem to be contradictories because the mean has not received a name.

5 

Good temper is a mean with respect to anger; the middle state being
unnamed, and the extremes almost without a name as well, we place
good temper in the middle position, though it inclines towards the
deficiency, which is without a name. The excess might called a sort
of 'irascibility'. For the passion is anger, while its causes are
many and diverse. 

The man who is angry at the right things and with the right people,
and, further, as he ought, when he ought, and as long as he ought,
is praised. This will be the good-tempered man, then, since good temper
is praised. For the good-tempered man tends to be unperturbed and
not to be led by passion, but to be angry in the manner, at the things,
and for the length of time, that the rule dictates; but he is thought
to err rather in the direction of deficiency; for the good-tempered
man is not revengeful, but rather tends to make allowances.

The deficiency, whether it is a sort of 'inirascibility' or whatever
it is, is blamed. For those who are not angry at the things they should
be angry at are thought to be fools, and so are those who are not
angry in the right way, at the right time, or with the right persons;
for such a man is thought not to feel things nor to be pained by them,
and, since he does not get angry, he is thought unlikely to defend
himself; and to endure being insulted and put up with insult to one's
friends is slavish. 

The excess can be manifested in all the points that have been named
(for one can be angry with the wrong persons, at the wrong things,
more than is right, too quickly, or too long); yet all are not found
in the same person. Indeed they could not; for evil destroys even
itself, and if it is complete becomes unbearable. Now hot-tempered
people get angry quickly and with the wrong persons and at the wrong
things and more than is right, but their anger ceases quickly-which
is the best point about them. This happens to them because they do
not restrain their anger but retaliate openly owing to their quickness
of temper, and then their anger ceases. By reason of excess choleric
people are quick-tempered and ready to be angry with everything and
on every occasion; whence their name. Sulky people are hard to appease,
and retain their anger long; for they repress their passion. But it
ceases when they retaliate; for revenge relieves them of their anger,
producing in them pleasure instead of pain. If this does not happen
they retain their burden; for owing to its not being obvious no one
even reasons with them, and to digest one's anger in oneself takes
time. Such people are most troublesome to themselves and to their
dearest friends. We call had-tempered those who are angry at the wrong
things, more than is right, and longer, and cannot be appeased until
they inflict vengeance or punishment. 

To good temper we oppose the excess rather than the defect; for not
only is it commoner since revenge is the more human), but bad-tempered
people are worse to live with. 

What we have said in our earlier treatment of the subject is plain
also from what we are now saying; viz. that it is not easy to define
how, with whom, at what, and how long one should be angry, and at
what point right action ceases and wrong begins. For the man who strays
a little from the path, either towards the more or towards the less,
is not blamed; since sometimes we praise those who exhibit the deficiency,
and call them good-tempered, and sometimes we call angry people manly,
as being capable of ruling. How far, therefore, and how a man must
stray before he becomes blameworthy, it is not easy to state in words;
for the decision depends on the particular facts and on perception.
But so much at least is plain, that the middle state is praiseworthy-
that in virtue of which we are angry with the right people, at the
right things, in the right way, and so on, while the excesses and
defects are blameworthy- slightly so if they are present in a low
degree, more if in a higher degree, and very much if in a high degree.
Evidently, then, we must cling to the middle state.- Enough of the
states relative to anger. 

6 

In gatherings of men, in social life and the interchange of words
and deeds, some men are thought to be obsequious, viz. those who to
give pleasure praise everything and never oppose, but think it their
duty 'to give no pain to the people they meet'; while those who, on
the contrary, oppose everything and care not a whit about giving pain
are called churlish and contentious. That the states we have named
are culpable is plain enough, and that the middle state is laudable-
that in virtue of which a man will put up with, and will resent, the
right things and in the right way; but no name has been assigned to
it, though it most resembles friendship. For the man who corresponds
to this middle state is very much what, with affection added, we call
a good friend. But the state in question differs from friendship in
that it implies no passion or affection for one's associates; since
it is not by reason of loving or hating that such a man takes everything
in the right way, but by being a man of a certain kind. For he will
behave so alike towards those he knows and those he does not know,
towards intimates and those who are not so, except that in each of
these cases he will behave as is befitting; for it is not proper to
have the same care for intimates and for strangers, nor again is it
the same conditions that make it right to give pain to them. Now we
have said generally that he will associate with people in the right
way; but it is by reference to what is honourable and expedient that
he will aim at not giving pain or at contributing pleasure. For he
seems to be concerned with the pleasures and pains of social life;
and wherever it is not honourable, or is harmful, for him to contribute
pleasure, he will refuse, and will choose rather to give pain; also
if his acquiescence in another's action would bring disgrace, and
that in a high degree, or injury, on that other, while his opposition
brings a little pain, he will not acquiesce but will decline. He will
associate differently with people in high station and with ordinary
people, with closer and more distant acquaintances, and so too with
regard to all other differences, rendering to each class what is befitting,
and while for its own sake he chooses to contribute pleasure, and
avoids the giving of pain, he will be guided by the consequences,
if these are greater, i.e. honour and expediency. For the sake of
a great future pleasure, too, he will inflict small pains.

The man who attains the mean, then, is such as we have described,
but has not received a name; of those who contribute pleasure, the
man who aims at being pleasant with no ulterior object is obsequious,
but the man who does so in order that he may get some advantage in
the direction of money or the things that money buys is a flatterer;
while the man who quarrels with everything is, as has been said, churlish
and contentious. And the extremes seem to be contradictory to each
other because the mean is without a name. 

7 

The mean opposed to boastfulness is found in almost the same sphere;
and this also is without a name. It will be no bad plan to describe
these states as well; for we shall both know the facts about character
better if we go through them in detail, and we shall be convinced
that the virtues are means if we see this to be so in all cases. In
the field of social life those who make the giving of pleasure or
pain their object in associating with others have been described;
let us now describe those who pursue truth or falsehood alike in words
and deeds and in the claims they put forward. The boastful man, then,
is thought to be apt to claim the things that bring glory, when he
has not got them, or to claim more of them than he has, and the mock-modest
man on the other hand to disclaim what he has or belittle it, while
the man who observes the mean is one who calls a thing by its own
name, being truthful both in life and in word, owning to what he has,
and neither more nor less. Now each of these courses may be adopted
either with or without an object. But each man speaks and acts and
lives in accordance with his character, if he is not acting for some
ulterior object. And falsehood is in itself mean and culpable, and
truth noble and worthy of praise. Thus the truthful man is another
case of a man who, being in the mean, is worthy of praise, and both
forms of untruthful man are culpable, and particularly the boastful
man. 

Let us discuss them both, but first of all the truthful man. We are
not speaking of the man who keeps faith in his agreements, i.e. in
the things that pertain to justice or injustice (for this would belong
to another virtue), but the man who in the matters in which nothing
of this sort is at stake is true both in word and in life because
his character is such. But such a man would seem to be as a matter
of fact equitable. For the man who loves truth, and is truthful where
nothing is at stake, will still more be truthful where something is
at stake; he will avoid falsehood as something base, seeing that he
avoided it even for its own sake; and such a man is worthy of praise.
He inclines rather to understate the truth; for this seems in better
taste because exaggerations are wearisome. 

He who claims more than he has with no ulterior object is a contemptible
sort of fellow (otherwise he would not have delighted in falsehood),
but seems futile rather than bad; but if he does it for an object,
he who does it for the sake of reputation or honour is (for a boaster)
not very much to be blamed, but he who does it for money, or the things
that lead to money, is an uglier character (it is not the capacity
that makes the boaster, but the purpose; for it is in virtue of his
state of character and by being a man of a certain kind that he is
boaster); as one man is a liar because he enjoys the lie itself, and
another because he desires reputation or gain. Now those who boast
for the sake of reputation claim such qualities as will praise or
congratulation, but those whose object is gain claim qualities which
are of value to one's neighbours and one's lack of which is not easily
detected, e.g. the powers of a seer, a sage, or a physician. For this
reason it is such things as these that most people claim and boast
about; for in them the above-mentioned qualities are found.

Mock-modest people, who understate things, seem more attractive in
character; for they are thought to speak not for gain but to avoid
parade; and here too it is qualities which bring reputation that they
disclaim, as Socrates used to do. Those who disclaim trifling and
obvious qualities are called humbugs and are more contemptible; and
sometimes this seems to be boastfulness, like the Spartan dress; for
both excess and great deficiency are boastful. But those who use understatement
with moderation and understate about matters that do not very much
force themselves on our notice seem attractive. And it is the boaster
that seems to be opposed to the truthful man; for he is the worse
character. 

8 

Since life includes rest as well as activity, and in this is included
leisure and amusement, there seems here also to be a kind of intercourse
which is tasteful; there is such a thing as saying- and again listening
to- what one should and as one should. The kind of people one is speaking
or listening to will also make a difference. Evidently here also there
is both an excess and a deficiency as compared with the mean. Those
who carry humour to excess are thought to be vulgar buffoons, striving
after humour at all costs, and aiming rather at raising a laugh than
at saying what is becoming and at avoiding pain to the object of their
fun; while those who can neither make a joke themselves nor put up
with those who do are thought to be boorish and unpolished. But those
who joke in a tasteful way are called ready-witted, which implies
a sort of readiness to turn this way and that; for such sallies are
thought to be movements of the character, and as bodies are discriminated
by their movements, so too are characters. The ridiculous side of
things is not far to seek, however, and most people delight more than
they should in amusement and in jestinly. and so even buffoons are
called ready-witted because they are found attractive; but that they
differ from the ready-witted man, and to no small extent, is clear
from what has been said. 

To the middle state belongs also tact; it is the mark of a tactful
man to say and listen to such things as befit a good and well-bred
man; for there are some things that it befits such a man to say and
to hear by way of jest, and the well-bred man's jesting differs from
that of a vulgar man, and the joking of an educated man from that
of an uneducated. One may see this even from the old and the new comedies;
to the authors of the former indecency of language was amusing, to
those of the latter innuendo is more so; and these differ in no small
degree in respect of propriety. Now should we define the man who jokes
well by his saying what is not unbecoming to a well-bred man, or by
his not giving pain, or even giving delight, to the hearer? Or is
the latter definition, at any rate, itself indefinite, since different
things are hateful or pleasant to different people? The kind of jokes
he will listen to will be the same; for the kind he can put up with
are also the kind he seems to make. There are, then, jokes he will
not make; for the jest is a sort of abuse, and there are things that
lawgivers forbid us to abuse; and they should, perhaps, have forbidden
us even to make a jest of such. The refined and well-bred man, therefore,
will be as we have described, being as it were a law to himself.

Such, then, is the man who observes the mean, whether he be called
tactful or ready-witted. The buffoon, on the other hand, is the slave
of his sense of humour, and spares neither himself nor others if he
can raise a laugh, and says things none of which a man of refinement
would say, and to some of which he would not even listen. The boor,
again, is useless for such social intercourse; for he contributes
nothing and finds fault with everything. But relaxation and amusement
are thought to be a necessary element in life. 

The means in life that have been described, then, are three in number,
and are all concerned with an interchange of words and deeds of some
kind. They differ, however, in that one is concerned with truth; and
the other two with pleasantness. Of those concerned with pleasure,
one is displayed in jests, the other in the general social intercourse
of life. 

9 

Shame should not be described as a virtue; for it is more like a feeling
than a state of character. It is defined, at any rate, as a kind of
fear of dishonour, and produces an effect similar to that produced
by fear of danger; for people who feel disgraced blush, and those
who fear death turn pale. Both, therefore, seem to be in a sense bodily
conditions, which is thought to be characteristic of feeling rather
than of a state of character. 

The feeling is not becoming to every age, but only to youth. For we
think young people should be prone to the feeling of shame because
they live by feeling and therefore commit many errors, but are restrained
by shame; and we praise young people who are prone to this feeling,
but an older person no one would praise for being prone to the sense
of disgrace, since we think he should not do anything that need cause
this sense. For the sense of disgrace is not even characteristic of
a good man, since it is consequent on bad actions (for such actions
should not be done; and if some actions are disgraceful in very truth
and others only according to common opinion, this makes no difference;
for neither class of actions should be done, so that no disgrace should
be felt); and it is a mark of a bad man even to be such as to do any
disgraceful action. To be so constituted as to feel disgraced if one
does such an action, and for this reason to think oneself good, is
absurd; for it is for voluntary actions that shame is felt, and the
good man will never voluntarily do bad actions. But shame may be said
to be conditionally a good thing; if a good man does such actions,
he will feel disgraced; but the virtues are not subject to such a
qualification. And if shamelessness-not to be ashamed of doing base
actions-is bad, that does not make it good to be ashamed of doing
such actions. Continence too is not virtue, but a mixed sort of state;
this will be shown later. Now, however, let us discuss justice.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK V

1 

With regards to justice and injustice we must (1) consider what kind
of actions they are concerned with, (2) what sort of mean justice
is, and (3) between what extremes the just act is intermediate. Our
investigation shall follow the same course as the preceding discussions.

We see that all men mean by justice that kind of state of character
which makes people disposed to do what is just and makes them act
justly and wish for what is just; and similarly by injustice that
state which makes them act unjustly and wish for what is unjust. Let
us too, then, lay this down as a general basis. For the same is not
true of the sciences and the faculties as of states of character.
A faculty or a science which is one and the same is held to relate
to contrary objects, but a state of character which is one of two
contraries does not produce the contrary results; e.g. as a result
of health we do not do what is the opposite of healthy, but only what
is healthy; for we say a man walks healthily, when he walks as a healthy
man would. 

Now often one contrary state is recognized from its contrary, and
often states are recognized from the subjects that exhibit them; for
(A) if good condition is known, bad condition also becomes known,
and (B) good condition is known from the things that are in good condition,
and they from it. If good condition is firmness of flesh, it is necessary
both that bad condition should be flabbiness of flesh and that the
wholesome should be that which causes firmness in flesh. And it follows
for the most part that if one contrary is ambiguous the other also
will be ambiguous; e.g. if 'just' is so, that 'unjust' will be so
too. 

Now 'justice' and 'injustice' seem to be ambiguous, but because their
different meanings approach near to one another the ambiguity escapes
notice and is not obvious as it is, comparatively, when the meanings
are far apart, e.g. (for here the difference in outward form is great)
as the ambiguity in the use of kleis for the collar-bone of an animal
and for that with which we lock a door. Let us take as a starting-point,
then, the various meanings of 'an unjust man'. Both the lawless man
and the grasping and unfair man are thought to be unjust, so that
evidently both the law-abiding and the fair man will be just. The
just, then, is the lawful and the fair, the unjust the unlawful and
the unfair. 

Since the unjust man is grasping, he must be concerned with goods-not
all goods, but those with which prosperity and adversity have to do,
which taken absolutely are always good, but for a particular person
are not always good. Now men pray for and pursue these things; but
they should not, but should pray that the things that are good absolutely
may also be good for them, and should choose the things that are good
for them. The unjust man does not always choose the greater, but also
the less-in the case of things bad absolutely; but because the lesser
evil is itself thought to be in a sense good, and graspingness is
directed at the good, therefore he is thought to be grasping. And
he is unfair; for this contains and is common to both. 

Since the lawless man was seen to be unjust and the law-abiding man
just, evidently all lawful acts are in a sense just acts; for the
acts laid down by the legislative art are lawful, and each of these,
we say, is just. Now the laws in their enactments on all subjects
aim at the common advantage either of all or of the best or of those
who hold power, or something of the sort; so that in one sense we
call those acts just that tend to produce and preserve happiness and
its components for the political society. And the law bids us do both
the acts of a brave man (e.g. not to desert our post nor take to flight
nor throw away our arms), and those of a temperate man (e.g. not to
commit adultery nor to gratify one's lust), and those of a good-tempered
man (e.g. not to strike another nor to speak evil), and similarly
with regard to the other virtues and forms of wickedness, commanding
some acts and forbidding others; and the rightly-framed law does this
rightly, and the hastily conceived one less well. This form of justice,
then, is complete virtue, but not absolutely, but in relation to our
neighbour. And therefore justice is often thought to be the greatest
of virtues, and 'neither evening nor morning star' is so wonderful;
and proverbially 'in justice is every virtue comprehended'. And it
is complete virtue in its fullest sense, because it is the actual
exercise of complete virtue. It is complete because he who possesses
it can exercise his virtue not only in himself but towards his neighbour
also; for many men can exercise virtue in their own affairs, but not
in their relations to their neighbour. This is why the saying of Bias
is thought to be true, that 'rule will show the man'; for a ruler
is necessarily in relation to other men and a member of a society.
For this same reason justice, alone of the virtues, is thought to
be 'another's good', because it is related to our neighbour; for it
does what is advantageous to another, either a ruler or a copartner.
Now the worst man is he who exercises his wickedness both towards
himself and towards his friends, and the best man is not he who exercises
his virtue towards himself but he who exercises it towards another;
for this is a difficult task. Justice in this sense, then, is not
part of virtue but virtue entire, nor is the contrary injustice a
part of vice but vice entire. What the difference is between virtue
and justice in this sense is plain from what we have said; they are
the same but their essence is not the same; what, as a relation to
one's neighbour, is justice is, as a certain kind of state without
qualification, virtue. 

2 

But at all events what we are investigating is the justice which is
a part of virtue; for there is a justice of this kind, as we maintain.
Similarly it is with injustice in the particular sense that we are
concerned. 

That there is such a thing is indicated by the fact that while the
man who exhibits in action the other forms of wickedness acts wrongly
indeed, but not graspingly (e.g. the man who throws away his shield
through cowardice or speaks harshly through bad temper or fails to
help a friend with money through meanness), when a man acts graspingly
he often exhibits none of these vices,-no, nor all together, but certainly
wickedness of some kind (for we blame him) and injustice. There is,
then, another kind of injustice which is a part of injustice in the
wide sense, and a use of the word 'unjust' which answers to a part
of what is unjust in the wide sense of 'contrary to the law'. Again
if one man commits adultery for the sake of gain and makes money by
it, while another does so at the bidding of appetite though he loses
money and is penalized for it, the latter would be held to be self-indulgent
rather than grasping, but the former is unjust, but not self-indulgent;
evidently, therefore, he is unjust by reason of his making gain by
his act. Again, all other unjust acts are ascribed invariably to some
particular kind of wickedness, e.g. adultery to self-indulgence, the
desertion of a comrade in battle to cowardice, physical violence to
anger; but if a man makes gain, his action is ascribed to no form
of wickedness but injustice. Evidently, therefore, there is apart
from injustice in the wide sense another, 'particular', injustice
which shares the name and nature of the first, because its definition
falls within the same genus; for the significance of both consists
in a relation to one's neighbour, but the one is concerned with honour
or money or safety-or that which includes all these, if we had a single
name for it-and its motive is the pleasure that arises from gain;
while the other is concerned with all the objects with which the good
man is concerned. 

It is clear, then, that there is more than one kind of justice, and
that there is one which is distinct from virtue entire; we must try
to grasp its genus and differentia. 

The unjust has been divided into the unlawful and the unfair, and
the just into the lawful and the fair. To the unlawful answers the
afore-mentioned sense of injustice. But since unfair and the unlawful
are not the same, but are different as a part is from its whole (for
all that is unfair is unlawful, but not all that is unlawful is unfair),
the unjust and injustice in the sense of the unfair are not the same
as but different from the former kind, as part from whole; for injustice
in this sense is a part of injustice in the wide sense, and similarly
justice in the one sense of justice in the other. Therefore we must
speak also about particular justice and particular and similarly about
the just and the unjust. The justice, then, which answers to the whole
of virtue, and the corresponding injustice, one being the exercise
of virtue as a whole, and the other that of vice as a whole, towards
one's neighbour, we may leave on one side. And how the meanings of
'just' and 'unjust' which answer to these are to be distinguished
is evident; for practically the majority of the acts commanded by
the law are those which are prescribed from the point of view of virtue
taken as a whole; for the law bids us practise every virtue and forbids
us to practise any vice. And the things that tend to produce virtue
taken as a whole are those of the acts prescribed by the law which
have been prescribed with a view to education for the common good.
But with regard to the education of the individual as such, which
makes him without qualification a good man, we must determine later
whether this is the function of the political art or of another; for
perhaps it is not the same to be a good man and a good citizen of
any state taken at random. 

Of particular justice and that which is just in the corresponding
sense, (A) one kind is that which is manifested in distributions of
honour or money or the other things that fall to be divided among
those who have a share in the constitution (for in these it is possible
for one man to have a share either unequal or equal to that of another),
and (B) one is that which plays a rectifying part in transactions
between man and man. Of this there are two divisions; of transactions
(1) some are voluntary and (2) others involuntary- voluntary such
transactions as sale, purchase, loan for consumption, pledging, loan
for use, depositing, letting (they are called voluntary because the
origin of these transactions is voluntary), while of the involuntary
(a) some are clandestine, such as theft, adultery, poisoning, procuring,
enticement of slaves, assassination, false witness, and (b) others
are violent, such as assault, imprisonment, murder, robbery with violence,
mutilation, abuse, insult. 

3 

(A) We have shown that both the unjust man and the unjust act are
unfair or unequal; now it is clear that there is also an intermediate
between the two unequals involved in either case. And this is the
equal; for in any kind of action in which there's a more and a less
there is also what is equal. If, then, the unjust is unequal, just
is equal, as all men suppose it to be, even apart from argument. And
since the equal is intermediate, the just will be an intermediate.
Now equality implies at least two things. The just, then, must be
both intermediate and equal and relative (i.e. for certain persons).
And since the equall intermediate it must be between certain things
(which are respectively greater and less); equal, it involves two
things; qua just, it is for certain people. The just, therefore, involves
at least four terms; for the persons for whom it is in fact just are
two, and the things in which it is manifested, the objects distributed,
are two. And the same equality will exist between the persons and
between the things concerned; for as the latter the things concerned-are
related, so are the former; if they are not equal, they will not have
what is equal, but this is the origin of quarrels and complaints-when
either equals have and are awarded unequal shares, or unequals equal
shares. Further, this is plain from the fact that awards should be
'according to merit'; for all men agree that what is just in distribution
must be according to merit in some sense, though they do not all specify
the same sort of merit, but democrats identify it with the status
of freeman, supporters of oligarchy with wealth (or with noble birth),
and supporters of aristocracy with excellence. 

The just, then, is a species of the proportionate (proportion being
not a property only of the kind of number which consists of abstract
units, but of number in general). For proportion is equality of ratios,
and involves four terms at least (that discrete proportion involves
four terms is plain, but so does continuous proportion, for it uses
one term as two and mentions it twice; e.g. 'as the line A is to the
line B, so is the line B to the line C'; the line B, then, has been
mentioned twice, so that if the line B be assumed twice, the proportional
terms will be four); and the just, too, involves at least four terms,
and the ratio between one pair is the same as that between the other
pair; for there is a similar distinction between the persons and between
the things. As the term A, then, is to B, so will C be to D, and therefore,
alternando, as A is to C, B will be to D. Therefore also the whole
is in the same ratio to the whole; and this coupling the distribution
effects, and, if the terms are so combined, effects justly. The conjunction,
then, of the term A with C and of B with D is what is just in distribution,
and this species of the just is intermediate, and the unjust is what
violates the proportion; for the proportional is intermediate, and
the just is proportional. (Mathematicians call this kind of proportion
geometrical; for it is in geometrical proportion that it follows that
the whole is to the whole as either part is to the corresponding part.)
This proportion is not continuous; for we cannot get a single term
standing for a person and a thing. 

This, then, is what the just is-the proportional; the unjust is what
violates the proportion. Hence one term becomes too great, the other
too small, as indeed happens in practice; for the man who acts unjustly
has too much, and the man who is unjustly treated too little, of what
is good. In the case of evil the reverse is true; for the lesser evil
is reckoned a good in comparison with the greater evil, since the
lesser evil is rather to be chosen than the greater, and what is worthy
of choice is good, and what is worthier of choice a greater good.

This, then, is one species of the just. 
4 

(B) The remaining one is the rectificatory, which arises in connexion
with transactions both voluntary and involuntary. This form of the
just has a different specific character from the former. For the justice
which distributes common possessions is always in accordance with
the kind of proportion mentioned above (for in the case also in which
the distribution is made from the common funds of a partnership it
will be according to the same ratio which the funds put into the business
by the partners bear to one another); and the injustice opposed to
this kind of justice is that which violates the proportion. But the
justice in transactions between man and man is a sort of equality
indeed, and the injustice a sort of inequality; not according to that
kind of proportion, however, but according to arithmetical proportion.
For it makes no difference whether a good man has defrauded a bad
man or a bad man a good one, nor whether it is a good or a bad man
that has committed adultery; the law looks only to the distinctive
character of the injury, and treats the parties as equal, if one is
in the wrong and the other is being wronged, and if one inflicted
injury and the other has received it. Therefore, this kind of injustice
being an inequality, the judge tries to equalize it; for in the case
also in which one has received and the other has inflicted a wound,
or one has slain and the other been slain, the suffering and the action
have been unequally distributed; but the judge tries to equalize by
means of the penalty, taking away from the gain of the assailant.
For the term 'gain' is applied generally to such cases, even if it
be not a term appropriate to certain cases, e.g. to the person who
inflicts a woundand 'loss' to the sufferer; at all events when the
suffering has been estimated, the one is called loss and the other
gain. Therefore the equal is intermediate between the greater and
the less, but the gain and the loss are respectively greater and less
in contrary ways; more of the good and less of the evil are gain,
and the contrary is loss; intermediate between them is, as we saw,
equal, which we say is just; therefore corrective justice will be
the intermediate between loss and gain. This is why, when people dispute,
they take refuge in the judge; and to go to the judge is to go to
justice; for the nature of the judge is to be a sort of animate justice;
and they seek the judge as an intermediate, and in some states they
call judges mediators, on the assumption that if they get what is
intermediate they will get what is just. The just, then, is an intermediate,
since the judge is so. Now the judge restores equality; it is as though
there were a line divided into unequal parts, and he took away that
by which the greater segment exceeds the half, and added it to the
smaller segment. And when the whole has been equally divided, then
they say they have 'their own'-i.e. when they have got what is equal.
The equal is intermediate between the greater and the lesser line
according to arithmetical proportion. It is for this reason also that
it is called just (sikaion), because it is a division into two equal
parts (sicha), just as if one were to call it sichaion; and the judge
(sikastes) is one who bisects (sichastes). For when something is subtracted
from one of two equals and added to the other, the other is in excess
by these two; since if what was taken from the one had not been added
to the other, the latter would have been in excess by one only. It
therefore exceeds the intermediate by one, and the intermediate exceeds
by one that from which something was taken. By this, then, we shall
recognize both what we must subtract from that which has more, and
what we must add to that which has less; we must add to the latter
that by which the intermediate exceeds it, and subtract from the greatest
that by which it exceeds the intermediate. Let the lines AA', BB',
CC' be equal to one another; from the line AA' let the segment AE
have been subtracted, and to the line CC' let the segment Cd have
been added, so that the whole line DCC' exceeds the line EA' by the
segment CD and the segment CF; therefore it exceeds the line Bb' by
the segment CD. (See diagram.) 

These names, both loss and gain, have come from voluntary exchange;
for to have more than one's own is called gaining, and to have less
than one's original share is called losing, e.g. in buying and selling
and in all other matters in which the law has left people free to
make their own terms; but when they get neither more nor less but
just what belongs to themselves, they say that they have their own
and that they neither lose nor gain. 

Therefore the just is intermediate between a sort of gain and a sort
of loss, viz. those which are involuntary; it consists in having an
equal amount before and after the transaction.

Some think that reciprocity is without qualification just, as the
Pythagoreans said; for they defined justice without qualification
as reciprocity. Now 'reciprocity' fits neither distributive nor rectificatory
justice-yet people want even the justice of Rhadamanthus to mean this:

Should a man suffer what he did, right justice would be done -for
in many cases reciprocity and rectificatory justice are not in accord;
e.g. (1) if an official has inflicted a wound, he should not be wounded
in return, and if some one has wounded an official, he ought not to
be wounded only but punished in addition. Further (2) there is a great
difference between a voluntary and an involuntary act. But in associations
for exchange this sort of justice does hold men together-reciprocity
in accordance with a proportion and not on the basis of precisely
equal return. For it is by proportionate requital that the city holds
together. Men seek to return either evil for evil-and if they cana
not do so, think their position mere slavery-or good for good-and
if they cannot do so there is no exchange, but it is by exchange that
they hold together. This is why they give a prominent place to the
temple of the Graces-to promote the requital of services; for this
is characteristic of grace-we should serve in return one who has shown
grace to us, and should another time take the initiative in showing
it. 

Now proportionate return is secured by cross-conjunction. Let A be
a builder, B a shoemaker, C a house, D a shoe. The builder, then,
must get from the shoemaker the latter's work, and must himself give
him in return his own. If, then, first there is proportionate equality
of goods, and then reciprocal action takes place, the result we mention
will be effected. If not, the bargain is not equal, and does not hold;
for there is nothing to prevent the work of the one being better than
that of the other; they must therefore be equated. (And this is true
of the other arts also; for they would have been destroyed if what
the patient suffered had not been just what the agent did, and of
the same amount and kind.) For it is not two doctors that associate
for exchange, but a doctor and a farmer, or in general people who
are different and unequal; but these must be equated. This is why
all things that are exchanged must be somehow comparable. It is for
this end that money has been introduced, and it becomes in a sense
an intermediate; for it measures all things, and therefore the excess
and the defect-how many shoes are equal to a house or to a given amount
of food. The number of shoes exchanged for a house (or for a given
amount of food) must therefore correspond to the ratio of builder
to shoemaker. For if this be not so, there will be no exchange and
no intercourse. And this proportion will not be effected unless the
goods are somehow equal. All goods must therefore be measured by some
one thing, as we said before. Now this unit is in truth demand, which
holds all things together (for if men did not need one another's goods
at all, or did not need them equally, there would be either no exchange
or not the same exchange); but money has become by convention a sort
of representative of demand; and this is why it has the name 'money'
(nomisma)-because it exists not by nature but by law (nomos) and it
is in our power to change it and make it useless. There will, then,
be reciprocity when the terms have been equated so that as farmer
is to shoemaker, the amount of the shoemaker's work is to that of
the farmer's work for which it exchanges. But we must not bring them
into a figure of proportion when they have already exchanged (otherwise
one extreme will have both excesses), but when they still have their
own goods. Thus they are equals and associates just because this equality
can be effected in their case. Let A be a farmer, C food, B a shoemaker,
D his product equated to C. If it had not been possible for reciprocity
to be thus effected, there would have been no association of the parties.
That demand holds things together as a single unit is shown by the
fact that when men do not need one another, i.e. when neither needs
the other or one does not need the other, they do not exchange, as
we do when some one wants what one has oneself, e.g. when people permit
the exportation of corn in exchange for wine. This equation therefore
must be established. And for the future exchange-that if we do not
need a thing now we shall have it if ever we do need it-money is as
it were our surety; for it must be possible for us to get what we
want by bringing the money. Now the same thing happens to money itself
as to goods-it is not always worth the same; yet it tends to be steadier.
This is why all goods must have a price set on them; for then there
will always be exchange, and if so, association of man with man. Money,
then, acting as a measure, makes goods commensurate and equates them;
for neither would there have been association if there were not exchange,
nor exchange if there were not equality, nor equality if there were
not commensurability. Now in truth it is impossible that things differing
so much should become commensurate, but with reference to demand they
may become so sufficiently. There must, then, be a unit, and that
fixed by agreement (for which reason it is called money); for it is
this that makes all things commensurate, since all things are measured
by money. Let A be a house, B ten minae, C a bed. A is half of B,
if the house is worth five minae or equal to them; the bed, C, is
a tenth of B; it is plain, then, how many beds are equal to a house,
viz. five. That exchange took place thus before there was money is
plain; for it makes no difference whether it is five beds that exchange
for a house, or the money value of five beds. 

We have now defined the unjust and the just. These having been marked
off from each other, it is plain that just action is intermediate
between acting unjustly and being unjustly treated; for the one is
to have too much and the other to have too little. Justice is a kind
of mean, but not in the same way as the other virtues, but because
it relates to an intermediate amount, while injustice relates to the
extremes. And justice is that in virtue of which the just man is said
to be a doer, by choice, of that which is just, and one who will distribute
either between himself and another or between two others not so as
to give more of what is desirable to himself and less to his neighbour
(and conversely with what is harmful), but so as to give what is equal
in accordance with proportion; and similarly in distributing between
two other persons. Injustice on the other hand is similarly related
to the unjust, which is excess and defect, contrary to proportion,
of the useful or hurtful. For which reason injustice is excess and
defect, viz. because it is productive of excess and defect-in one's
own case excess of what is in its own nature useful and defect of
what is hurtful, while in the case of others it is as a whole like
what it is in one's own case, but proportion may be violated in either
direction. In the unjust act to have too little is to be unjustly
treated; to have too much is to act unjustly. 

Let this be taken as our account of the nature of justice and injustice,
and similarly of the just and the unjust in general. 

6 

Since acting unjustly does not necessarily imply being unjust, we
must ask what sort of unjust acts imply that the doer is unjust with
respect to each type of injustice, e.g. a thief, an adulterer, or
a brigand. Surely the answer does not turn on the difference between
these types. For a man might even lie with a woman knowing who she
was, but the origin of his might be not deliberate choice but passion.
He acts unjustly, then, but is not unjust; e.g. a man is not a thief,
yet he stole, nor an adulterer, yet he committed adultery; and similarly
in all other cases. 

Now we have previously stated how the reciprocal is related to the
just; but we must not forget that what we are looking for is not only
what is just without qualification but also political justice. This
is found among men who share their life with a view to selfsufficiency,
men who are free and either proportionately or arithmetically equal,
so that between those who do not fulfil this condition there is no
political justice but justice in a special sense and by analogy. For
justice exists only between men whose mutual relations are governed
by law; and law exists for men between whom there is injustice; for
legal justice is the discrimination of the just and the unjust. And
between men between whom there is injustice there is also unjust action
(though there is not injustice between all between whom there is unjust
action), and this is assigning too much to oneself of things good
in themselves and too little of things evil in themselves. This is
why we do not allow a man to rule, but rational principle, because
a man behaves thus in his own interests and becomes a tyrant. The
magistrate on the other hand is the guardian of justice, and, if of
justice, then of equality also. And since he is assumed to have no
more than his share, if he is just (for he does not assign to himself
more of what is good in itself, unless such a share is proportional
to his merits-so that it is for others that he labours, and it is
for this reason that men, as we stated previously, say that justice
is 'another's good'), therefore a reward must be given him, and this
is honour and privilege; but those for whom such things are not enough
become tyrants. 

The justice of a master and that of a father are not the same as the
justice of citizens, though they are like it; for there can be no
injustice in the unqualified sense towards thing that are one's own,
but a man's chattel, and his child until it reaches a certain age
and sets up for itself, are as it were part of himself, and no one
chooses to hurt himself (for which reason there can be no injustice
towards oneself). Therefore the justice or injustice of citizens is
not manifested in these relations; for it was as we saw according
to law, and between people naturally subject to law, and these as
we saw' are people who have an equal share in ruling and being ruled.
Hence justice can more truly be manifested towards a wife than towards
children and chattels, for the former is household justice; but even
this is different from political justice. 

7 

Of political justice part is natural, part legal, natural, that which
everywhere has the same force and does not exist by people's thinking
this or that; legal, that which is originally indifferent, but when
it has been laid down is not indifferent, e.g. that a prisoner's ransom
shall be a mina, or that a goat and not two sheep shall be sacrificed,
and again all the laws that are passed for particular cases, e.g.
that sacrifice shall be made in honour of Brasidas, and the provisions
of decrees. Now some think that all justice is of this sort, because
that which is by nature is unchangeable and has everywhere the same
force (as fire burns both here and in Persia), while they see change
in the things recognized as just. This, however, is not true in this
unqualified way, but is true in a sense; or rather, with the gods
it is perhaps not true at all, while with us there is something that
is just even by nature, yet all of it is changeable; but still some
is by nature, some not by nature. It is evident which sort of thing,
among things capable of being otherwise, is by nature, and which is
not but is legal and conventional, assuming that both are equally
changeable. And in all other things the same distinction will apply;
by nature the right hand is stronger, yet it is possible that all
men should come to be ambidextrous. The things which are just by virtue
of convention and expediency are like measures; for wine and corn
measures are not everywhere equal, but larger in wholesale and smaller
in retail markets. Similarly, the things which are just not by nature
but by human enactment are not everywhere the same, since constitutions
also are not the same, though there is but one which is everywhere
by nature the best. Of things just and lawful each is related as the
universal to its particulars; for the things that are done are many,
but of them each is one, since it is universal. 

There is a difference between the act of injustice and what is unjust,
and between the act of justice and what is just; for a thing is unjust
by nature or by enactment; and this very thing, when it has been done,
is an act of injustice, but before it is done is not yet that but
is unjust. So, too, with an act of justice (though the general term
is rather 'just action', and 'act of justice' is applied to the correction
of the act of injustice). 

Each of these must later be examined separately with regard to the
nature and number of its species and the nature of the things with
which it is concerned. 

8 

Acts just and unjust being as we have described them, a man acts unjustly
or justly whenever he does such acts voluntarily; when involuntarily,
he acts neither unjustly nor justly except in an incidental way; for
he does things which happen to be just or unjust. Whether an act is
or is not one of injustice (or of justice) is determined by its voluntariness
or involuntariness; for when it is voluntary it is blamed, and at
the same time is then an act of injustice; so that there will be things
that are unjust but not yet acts of injustice, if voluntariness be
not present as well. By the voluntary I mean, as has been said before,
any of the things in a man's own power which he does with knowledge,
i.e. not in ignorance either of the person acted on or of the instrument
used or of the end that will be attained (e.g. whom he is striking,
with what, and to what end), each such act being done not incidentally
nor under compulsion (e.g. if A takes B's hand and therewith strikes
C, B does not act voluntarily; for the act was not in his own power).
The person struck may be the striker's father, and the striker may
know that it is a man or one of the persons present, but not know
that it is his father; a similar distinction may be made in the case
of the end, and with regard to the whole action. Therefore that which
is done in ignorance, or though not done in ignorance is not in the
agent's power, or is done under compulsion, is involuntary (for many
natural processes, even, we knowingly both perform and experience,
none of which is either voluntary or involuntary; e.g. growing old
or dying). But in the case of unjust and just acts alike the injustice
or justice may be only incidental; for a man might return a deposit
unwillingly and from fear, and then he must not be said either to
do what is just or to act justly, except in an incidental way. Similarly
the man who under compulsion and unwillingly fails to return the deposit
must be said to act unjustly, and to do what is unjust, only incidentally.
Of voluntary acts we do some by choice, others not by choice; by choice
those which we do after deliberation, not by choice those which we
do without previous deliberation. Thus there are three kinds of injury
in transactions between man and man; those done in ignorance are mistakes
when the person acted on, the act, the instrument, or the end that
will be attained is other than the agent supposed; the agent thought
either that he was not hiting any one or that he was not hitting with
this missile or not hitting this person or to this end, but a result
followed other than that which he thought likely (e.g. he threw not
with intent to wound but only to prick), or the person hit or the
missile was other than he supposed. Now when (1) the injury takes
place contrary to reasonable expectation, it is a misadventure. When
(2) it is not contrary to reasonable expectation, but does not imply
vice, it is a mistake (for a man makes a mistake when the fault originates
in him, but is the victim of accident when the origin lies outside
him). When (3) he acts with knowledge but not after deliberation,
it is an act of injustice-e.g. the acts due to anger or to other passions
necessary or natural to man; for when men do such harmful and mistaken
acts they act unjustly, and the acts are acts of injustice, but this
does not imply that the doers are unjust or wicked; for the injury
is not due to vice. But when (4) a man acts from choice, he is an
unjust man and a vicious man. 

Hence acts proceeding from anger are rightly judged not to be done
of malice aforethought; for it is not the man who acts in anger but
he who enraged him that starts the mischief. Again, the matter in
dispute is not whether the thing happened or not, but its justice;
for it is apparent injustice that occasions rage. For they do not
dispute about the occurrence of the act-as in commercial transactions
where one of the two parties must be vicious-unless they do so owing
to forgetfulness; but, agreeing about the fact, they dispute on which
side justice lies (whereas a man who has deliberately injured another
cannot help knowing that he has done so), so that the one thinks he
is being treated unjustly and the other disagrees. 

But if a man harms another by choice, he acts unjustly; and these
are the acts of injustice which imply that the doer is an unjust man,
provided that the act violates proportion or equality. Similarly,
a man is just when he acts justly by choice; but he acts justly if
he merely acts voluntarily. 

Of involuntary acts some are excusable, others not. For the mistakes
which men make not only in ignorance but also from ignorance are excusable,
while those which men do not from ignorance but (though they do them
in ignorance) owing to a passion which is neither natural nor such
as man is liable to, are not excusable.

Assuming that we have sufficiently defined the suffering and doing
of injustice, it may be asked (1) whether the truth in expressed in
Euripides' paradoxical words: 

I slew my mother, that's my tale in brief. 
Were you both willing, or unwilling both? 

Is it truly possible to be willingly treated unjustly, or is all suffering
of injustice the contrary involuntary, as all unjust action is voluntary?
And is all suffering of injustice of the latter kind or else all of
the former, or is it sometimes voluntary, sometimes involuntary? So,
too, with the case of being justly treated; all just action is voluntary,
so that it is reasonable that there should be a similar opposition
in either case-that both being unjustly and being justly treated should
be either alike voluntary or alike involuntary. But it would be thought
paradoxical even in the case of being justly treated, if it were always
voluntary; for some are unwillingly treated justly. (2) One might
raise this question also, whether every one who has suffered what
is unjust is being unjustly treated, or on the other hand it is with
suffering as with acting. In action and in passivity alike it is possible
to partake of justice incidentally, and similarly (it is plain) of
injustice; for to do what is unjust is not the same as to act unjustly,
nor to suffer what is unjust as to be treated unjustly, and similarly
in the case of acting justly and being justly treated; for it is impossible
to be unjustly treated if the other does not act unjustly, or justly
treated unless he acts justly. Now if to act unjustly is simply to
harm some one voluntarily, and 'voluntarily' means 'knowing the person
acted on, the instrument, and the manner of one's acting', and the
incontinent man voluntarily harms himself, not only will he voluntarily
be unjustly treated but it will be possible to treat oneself unjustly.
(This also is one of the questions in doubt, whether a man can treat
himself unjustly.) Again, a man may voluntarily, owing to incontinence,
be harmed by another who acts voluntarily, so that it would be possible
to be voluntarily treated unjustly. Or is our definition incorrect;
must we to 'harming another, with knowledge both of the person acted
on, of the instrument, and of the manner' add 'contrary to the wish
of the person acted on'? Then a man may be voluntarily harmed and
voluntarily suffer what is unjust, but no one is voluntarily treated
unjustly; for no one wishes to be unjustly treated, not even the incontinent
man. He acts contrary to his wish; for no one wishes for what he does
not think to be good, but the incontinent man does do things that
he does not think he ought to do. Again, one who gives what is his
own, as Homer says Glaucus gave Diomede 

Armour of gold for brazen, the price of a hundred beeves for nine,
is not unjustly treated; for though to give is in his power, to be
unjustly treated is not, but there must be some one to treat him unjustly.
It is plain, then, that being unjustly treated is not voluntary.

Of the questions we intended to discuss two still remain for discussion;
(3) whether it is the man who has assigned to another more than his
share that acts unjustly, or he who has the excessive share, and (4)
whether it is possible to treat oneself unjustly. The questions are
connected; for if the former alternative is possible and the distributor
acts unjustly and not the man who has the excessive share, then if
a man assigns more to another than to himself, knowingly and voluntarily,
he treats himself unjustly; which is what modest people seem to do,
since the virtuous man tends to take less than his share. Or does
this statement too need qualification? For (a) he perhaps gets more
than his share of some other good, e.g. of honour or of intrinsic
nobility. (b) The question is solved by applying the distinction we
applied to unjust action; for he suffers nothing contrary to his own
wish, so that he is not unjustly treated as far as this goes, but
at most only suffers harm. 

It is plain too that the distributor acts unjustly, but not always
the man who has the excessive share; for it is not he to whom what
is unjust appertains that acts unjustly, but he to whom it appertains
to do the unjust act voluntarily, i.e. the person in whom lies the
origin of the action, and this lies in the distributor, not in the
receiver. Again, since the word 'do' is ambiguous, and there is a
sense in which lifeless things, or a hand, or a servant who obeys
an order, may be said to slay, he who gets an excessive share does
not act unjustly, though he 'does' what is unjust. 

Again, if the distributor gave his judgement in ignorance, he does
not act unjustly in respect of legal justice, and his judgement is
not unjust in this sense, but in a sense it is unjust (for legal justice
and primordial justice are different); but if with knowledge he judged
unjustly, he is himself aiming at an excessive share either of gratitude
or of revenge. As much, then, as if he were to share in the plunder,
the man who has judged unjustly for these reasons has got too much;
the fact that what he gets is different from what he distributes makes
no difference, for even if he awards land with a view to sharing in
the plunder he gets not land but money. 

Men think that acting unjustly is in their power, and therefore that
being just is easy. But it is not; to lie with one's neighbour's wife,
to wound another, to deliver a bribe, is easy and in our power, but
to do these things as a result of a certain state of character is
neither easy nor in our power. Similarly to know what is just and
what is unjust requires, men think, no great wisdom, because it is
not hard to understand the matters dealt with by the laws (though
these are not the things that are just, except incidentally); but
how actions must be done and distributions effected in order to be
just, to know this is a greater achievement than knowing what is good
for the health; though even there, while it is easy to know that honey,
wine, hellebore, cautery, and the use of the knife are so, to know
how, to whom, and when these should be applied with a view to producing
health, is no less an achievement than that of being a physician.
Again, for this very reason men think that acting unjustly is characteristic
of the just man no less than of the unjust, because he would be not
less but even more capable of doing each of these unjust acts; for
he could lie with a woman or wound a neighbour; and the brave man
could throw away his shield and turn to flight in this direction or
in that. But to play the coward or to act unjustly consists not in
doing these things, except incidentally, but in doing them as the
result of a certain state of character, just as to practise medicine
and healing consists not in applying or not applying the knife, in
using or not using medicines, but in doing so in a certain way.

Just acts occur between people who participate in things good in themselves
and can have too much or too little of them; for some beings (e.g.
presumably the gods) cannot have too much of them, and to others,
those who are incurably bad, not even the smallest share in them is
beneficial but all such goods are harmful, while to others they are
beneficial up to a point; therefore justice is essentially something
human. 

10 
Our next subject is equity and the equitable (to epiekes), and their
respective relations to justice and the just. For on examination they
appear to be neither absolutely the same nor generically different;
and while we sometime praise what is equitable and the equitable man
(so that we apply the name by way of praise even to instances of the
other virtues, instead of 'good' meaning by epieikestebon that a thing
is better), at other times, when we reason it out, it seems strange
if the equitable, being something different from the just, is yet
praiseworthy; for either the just or the equitable is not good, if
they are different; or, if both are good, they are the same.

These, then, are pretty much the considerations that give rise to
the problem about the equitable; they are all in a sense correct and
not opposed to one another; for the equitable, though it is better
than one kind of justice, yet is just, and it is not as being a different
class of thing that it is better than the just. The same thing, then,
is just and equitable, and while both are good the equitable is superior.
What creates the problem is that the equitable is just, but not the
legally just but a correction of legal justice. The reason is that
all law is universal but about some things it is not possible to make
a universal statement which shall be correct. In those cases, then,
in which it is necessary to speak universally, but not possible to
do so correctly, the law takes the usual case, though it is not ignorant
of the possibility of error. And it is none the less correct; for
the error is in the law nor in the legislator but in the nature of
the thing, since the matter of practical affairs is of this kind from
the start. When the law speaks universally, then, and a case arises
on it which is not covered by the universal statement, then it is
right, where the legislator fails us and has erred by oversimplicity,
to correct the omission-to say what the legislator himself would have
said had he been present, and would have put into his law if he had
known. Hence the equitable is just, and better than one kind of justice-not
better than absolute justice but better than the error that arises
from the absoluteness of the statement. And this is the nature of
the equitable, a correction of law where it is defective owing to
its universality. In fact this is the reason why all things are not
determined by law, that about some things it is impossible to lay
down a law, so that a decree is needed. For when the thing is indefinite
the rule also is indefinite, like the leaden rule used in making the
Lesbian moulding; the rule adapts itself to the shape of the stone
and is not rigid, and so too the decree is adapted to the facts.

It is plain, then, what the equitable is, and that it is just and
is better than one kind of justice. It is evident also from this who
the equitable man is; the man who chooses and does such acts, and
is no stickler for his rights in a bad sense but tends to take less
than his share though he has the law oft his side, is equitable, and
this state of character is equity, which is a sort of justice and
not a different state of character. 

11 

Whether a man can treat himself unjustly or not, is evident from what
has been said. For (a) one class of just acts are those acts in accordance
with any virtue which are prescribed by the law; e.g. the law does
not expressly permit suicide, and what it does not expressly permit
it forbids. Again, when a man in violation of the law harms another
(otherwise than in retaliation) voluntarily, he acts unjustly, and
a voluntary agent is one who knows both the person he is affecting
by his action and the instrument he is using; and he who through anger
voluntarily stabs himself does this contrary to the right rule of
life, and this the law does not allow; therefore he is acting unjustly.
But towards whom? Surely towards the state, not towards himself. For
he suffers voluntarily, but no one is voluntarily treated unjustly.
This is also the reason why the state punishes; a certain loss of
civil rights attaches to the man who destroys himself, on the ground
that he is treating the state unjustly. 

Further (b) in that sense of 'acting unjustly' in which the man who
'acts unjustly' is unjust only and not bad all round, it is not possible
to treat oneself unjustly (this is different from the former sense;
the unjust man in one sense of the term is wicked in a particularized
way just as the coward is, not in the sense of being wicked all round,
so that his 'unjust act' does not manifest wickedness in general).
For (i) that would imply the possibility of the same thing's having
been subtracted from and added to the same thing at the same time;
but this is impossible-the just and the unjust always involve more
than one person. Further, (ii) unjust action is voluntary and done
by choice, and takes the initiative (for the man who because he has
suffered does the same in return is not thought to act unjustly);
but if a man harms himself he suffers and does the same things at
the same time. Further, (iii) if a man could treat himself unjustly,
he could be voluntarily treated unjustly. Besides, (iv) no one acts
unjustly without committing particular acts of injustice; but no one
can commit adultery with his own wife or housebreaking on his own
house or theft on his own property, 

In general, the question 'can a man treat himself unjustly?' is solved
also by the distinction we applied to the question 'can a man be voluntarily
treated unjustly?' 

(It is evident too that both are bad, being unjustly treated and acting
unjustly; for the one means having less and the other having more
than the intermediate amount, which plays the part here that the healthy
does in the medical art, and that good condition does in the art of
bodily training. But still acting unjustly is the worse, for it involves
vice and is blameworthy-involves vice which is either of the complete
and unqualified kind or almost so (we must admit the latter alternative,
because not all voluntary unjust action implies injustice as a state
of character), while being unjustly treated does not involve vice
and injustice in oneself. In itself, then, being unjustly treated
is less bad, but there is nothing to prevent its being incidentally
a greater evil. But theory cares nothing for this; it calls pleurisy
a more serious mischief than a stumble; yet the latter may become
incidentally the more serious, if the fall due to it leads to your
being taken prisoner or put to death the enemy.) 

Metaphorically and in virtue of a certain resemblance there is a justice,
not indeed between a man and himself, but between certain parts of
him; yet not every kind of justice but that of master and servant
or that of husband and wife. For these are the ratios in which the
part of the soul that has a rational principle stands to the irrational
part; and it is with a view to these parts that people also think
a man can be unjust to himself, viz. because these parts are liable
to suffer something contrary to their respective desires; there is
therefore thought to be a mutual justice between them as between ruler
and ruled. 

Let this be taken as our account of justice and the other, i.e. the
other moral, virtues. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK VI

1 

Since we have previously said that one ought to choose that which
is intermediate, not the excess nor the defect, and that the intermediate
is determined by the dictates of the right rule, let us discuss the
nature of these dictates. In all the states of character we have mentioned,
as in all other matters, there is a mark to which the man who has
the rule looks, and heightens or relaxes his activity accordingly,
and there is a standard which determines the mean states which we
say are intermediate between excess and defect, being in accordance
with the right rule. But such a statement, though true, is by no means
clear; for not only here but in all other pursuits which are objects
of knowledge it is indeed true to say that we must not exert ourselves
nor relax our efforts too much nor too little, but to an intermediate
extent and as the right rule dictates; but if a man had only this
knowledge he would be none the wiser e.g. we should not know what
sort of medicines to apply to our body if some one were to say 'all
those which the medical art prescribes, and which agree with the practice
of one who possesses the art'. Hence it is necessary with regard to
the states of the soul also not only that this true statement should
be made, but also that it should be determined what is the right rule
and what is the standard that fixes it. 

We divided the virtues of the soul and a said that some are virtues
of character and others of intellect. Now we have discussed in detail
the moral virtues; with regard to the others let us express our view
as follows, beginning with some remarks about the soul. We said before
that there are two parts of the soul-that which grasps a rule or rational
principle, and the irrational; let us now draw a similar distinction
within the part which grasps a rational principle. And let it be assumed
that there are two parts which grasp a rational principle-one by which
we contemplate the kind of things whose originative causes are invariable,
and one by which we contemplate variable things; for where objects
differ in kind the part of the soul answering to each of the two is
different in kind, since it is in virtue of a certain likeness and
kinship with their objects that they have the knowledge they have.
Let one of these parts be called the scientific and the other the
calculative; for to deliberate and to calculate are the same thing,
but no one deliberates about the invariable. Therefore the calculative
is one part of the faculty which grasps a rational principle. We must,
then, learn what is the best state of each of these two parts; for
this is the virtue of each. 

2 

The virtue of a thing is relative to its proper work. Now there are
three things in the soul which control action and truth-sensation,
reason, desire. 

Of these sensation originates no action; this is plain from the fact
that the lower animals have sensation but no share in action.

What affirmation and negation are in thinking, pursuit and avoidance
are in desire; so that since moral virtue is a state of character
concerned with choice, and choice is deliberate desire, therefore
both the reasoning must be true and the desire right, if the choice
is to be good, and the latter must pursue just what the former asserts.
Now this kind of intellect and of truth is practical; of the intellect
which is contemplative, not practical nor productive, the good and
the bad state are truth and falsity respectively (for this is the
work of everything intellectual); while of the part which is practical
and intellectual the good state is truth in agreement with right desire.

The origin of action-its efficient, not its final cause-is choice,
and that of choice is desire and reasoning with a view to an end.
This is why choice cannot exist either without reason and intellect
or without a moral state; for good action and its opposite cannot
exist without a combination of intellect and character. Intellect
itself, however, moves nothing, but only the intellect which aims
at an end and is practical; for this rules the productive intellect,
as well, since every one who makes makes for an end, and that which
is made is not an end in the unqualified sense (but only an end in
a particular relation, and the end of a particular operation)-only
that which is done is that; for good action is an end, and desire
aims at this. Hence choice is either desiderative reason or ratiocinative
desire, and such an origin of action is a man. (It is to be noted
that nothing that is past is an object of choice, e.g. no one chooses
to have sacked Troy; for no one deliberates about the past, but about
what is future and capable of being otherwise, while what is past
is not capable of not having taken place; hence Agathon is right in
saying 

For this alone is lacking even to God, 
To make undone things thathave once been done.) 

The work of both the intellectual parts, then, is truth. Therefore
the states that are most strictly those in respect of which each of
these parts will reach truth are the virtues of the two parts.

3 

Let us begin, then, from the beginning, and discuss these states once
more. Let it be assumed that the states by virtue of which the soul
possesses truth by way of affirmation or denial are five in number,
i.e. art, scientific knowledge, practical wisdom, philosophic wisdom,
intuitive reason; we do not include judgement and opinion because
in these we may be mistaken. 

Now what scientific knowledge is, if we are to speak exactly and not
follow mere similarities, is plain from what follows. We all suppose
that what we know is not even capable of being otherwise; of things
capable of being otherwise we do not know, when they have passed outside
our observation, whether they exist or not. Therefore the object of
scientific knowledge is of necessity. Therefore it is eternal; for
things that are of necessity in the unqualified sense are all eternal;
and things that are eternal are ungenerated and imperishable. Again,
every science is thought to be capable of being taught, and its object
of being learned. And all teaching starts from what is already known,
as we maintain in the Analytics also; for it proceeds sometimes through
induction and sometimes by syllogism. Now induction is the starting-point
which knowledge even of the universal presupposes, while syllogism
proceeds from universals. There are therefore starting-points from
which syllogism proceeds, which are not reached by syllogism; it is
therefore by induction that they are acquired. Scientific knowledge
is, then, a state of capacity to demonstrate, and has the other limiting
characteristics which we specify in the Analytics, for it is when
a man believes in a certain way and the starting-points are known
to him that he has scientific knowledge, since if they are not better
known to him than the conclusion, he will have his knowledge only
incidentally. 

Let this, then, be taken as our account of scientific knowledge.

4 

In the variable are included both things made and things done; making
and acting are different (for their nature we treat even the discussions
outside our school as reliable); so that the reasoned state of capacity
to act is different from the reasoned state of capacity to make. Hence
too they are not included one in the other; for neither is acting
making nor is making acting. Now since architecture is an art and
is essentially a reasoned state of capacity to make, and there is
neither any art that is not such a state nor any such state that is
not an art, art is identical with a state of capacity to make, involving
a true course of reasoning. All art is concerned with coming into
being, i.e. with contriving and considering how something may come
into being which is capable of either being or not being, and whose
origin is in the maker and not in the thing made; for art is concerned
neither with things that are, or come into being, by necessity, nor
with things that do so in accordance with nature (since these have
their origin in themselves). Making and acting being different, art
must be a matter of making, not of acting. And in a sense chance and
art are concerned with the same objects; as Agathon says, 'art loves
chance and chance loves art'. Art, then, as has been is a state concerned
with making, involving a true course of reasoning, and lack of art
on the contrary is a state concerned with making, involving a false
course of reasoning; both are concerned with the variable.

5 

Regarding practical wisdom we shall get at the truth by considering
who are the persons we credit with it. Now it is thought to be the
mark of a man of practical wisdom to be able to deliberate well about
what is good and expedient for himself, not in some particular respect,
e.g. about what sorts of thing conduce to health or to strength, but
about what sorts of thing conduce to the good life in general. This
is shown by the fact that we credit men with practical wisdom in some
particular respect when they have calculated well with a view to some
good end which is one of those that are not the object of any art.
It follows that in the general sense also the man who is capable of
deliberating has practical wisdom. Now no one deliberates about things
that are invariable, nor about things that it is impossible for him
to do. Therefore, since scientific knowledge involves demonstration,
but there is no demonstration of things whose first principles are
variable (for all such things might actually be otherwise), and since
it is impossible to deliberate about things that are of necessity,
practical wisdom cannot be scientific knowledge nor art; not science
because that which can be done is capable of being otherwise, not
art because action and making are different kinds of thing. The remaining
alternative, then, is that it is a true and reasoned state of capacity
to act with regard to the things that are good or bad for man. For
while making has an end other than itself, action cannot; for good
action itself is its end. It is for this reason that we think Pericles
and men like him have practical wisdom, viz. because they can see
what is good for themselves and what is good for men in general; we
consider that those can do this who are good at managing households
or states. (This is why we call temperance (sophrosune) by this name;
we imply that it preserves one's practical wisdom (sozousa tan phronsin).
Now what it preserves is a judgement of the kind we have described.
For it is not any and every judgement that pleasant and painful objects
destroy and pervert, e.g. the judgement that the triangle has or has
not its angles equal to two right angles, but only judgements about
what is to be done. For the originating causes of the things that
are done consist in the end at which they are aimed; but the man who
has been ruined by pleasure or pain forthwith fails to see any such
originating cause-to see that for the sake of this or because of this
he ought to choose and do whatever he chooses and does; for vice is
destructive of the originating cause of action.) Practical wisdom,
then, must be a reasoned and true state of capacity to act with regard
to human goods. But further, while there is such a thing as excellence
in art, there is no such thing as excellence in practical wisdom;
and in art he who errs willingly is preferable, but in practical wisdom,
as in the virtues, he is the reverse. Plainly, then, practical wisdom
is a virtue and not an art. There being two parts of the soul that
can follow a course of reasoning, it must be the virtue of one of
the two, i.e. of that part which forms opinions; for opinion is about
the variable and so is practical wisdom. But yet it is not only a
reasoned state; this is shown by the fact that a state of that sort
may forgotten but practical wisdom cannot. 

6 

Scientific knowledge is judgement about things that are universal
and necessary, and the conclusions of demonstration, and all scientific
knowledge, follow from first principles (for scientific knowledge
involves apprehension of a rational ground). This being so, the first
principle from which what is scientifically known follows cannot be
an object of scientific knowledge, of art, or of practical wisdom;
for that which can be scientifically known can be demonstrated, and
art and practical wisdom deal with things that are variable. Nor are
these first principles the objects of philosophic wisdom, for it is
a mark of the philosopher to have demonstration about some things.
If, then, the states of mind by which we have truth and are never
deceived about things invariable or even variable are scientific knowlededge,
practical wisdom, philosophic wisdom, and intuitive reason, and it
cannot be any of the three (i.e. practical wisdom, scientific knowledge,
or philosophic wisdom), the remaining alternative is that it is intuitive
reason that grasps the first principles. 

7 

Wisdom (1) in the arts we ascribe to their most finished exponents,
e.g. to Phidias as a sculptor and to Polyclitus as a maker of portrait-statues,
and here we mean nothing by wisdom except excellence in art; but (2)
we think that some people are wise in general, not in some particular
field or in any other limited respect, as Homer says in the Margites,

Him did the gods make neither a digger nor yet a ploughman

Nor wise in anything else. Therefore wisdom must plainly be the most
finished of the forms of knowledge. It follows that the wise man must
not only know what follows from the first principles, but must also
possess truth about the first principles. Therefore wisdom must be
intuitive reason combined with scientific knowledge-scientific knowledge
of the highest objects which has received as it were its proper completion.

Of the highest objects, we say; for it would be strange to think that
the art of politics, or practical wisdom, is the best knowledge, since
man is not the best thing in the world. Now if what is healthy or
good is different for men and for fishes, but what is white or straight
is always the same, any one would say that what is wise is the same
but what is practically wise is different; for it is to that which
observes well the various matters concerning itself that one ascribes
practical wisdom, and it is to this that one will entrust such matters.
This is why we say that some even of the lower animals have practical
wisdom, viz. those which are found to have a power of foresight with
regard to their own life. It is evident also that philosophic wisdom
and the art of politics cannot be the same; for if the state of mind
concerned with a man's own interests is to be called philosophic wisdom,
there will be many philosophic wisdoms; there will not be one concerned
with the good of all animals (any more than there is one art of medicine
for all existing things), but a different philosophic wisdom about
the good of each species. 

But if the argument be that man is the best of the animals, this makes
no difference; for there are other things much more divine in their
nature even than man, e.g., most conspicuously, the bodies of which
the heavens are framed. From what has been said it is plain, then,
that philosophic wisdom is scientific knowledge, combined with intuitive
reason, of the things that are highest by nature. This is why we say
Anaxagoras, Thales, and men like them have philosophic but not practical
wisdom, when we see them ignorant of what is to their own advantage,
and why we say that they know things that are remarkable, admirable,
difficult, and divine, but useless; viz. because it is not human goods
that they seek. 

Practical wisdom on the other hand is concerned with things human
and things about which it is possible to deliberate; for we say this
is above all the work of the man of practical wisdom, to deliberate
well, but no one deliberates about things invariable, nor about things
which have not an end, and that a good that can be brought about by
action. The man who is without qualification good at deliberating
is the man who is capable of aiming in accordance with calculation
at the best for man of things attainable by action. Nor is practical
wisdom concerned with universals only-it must also recognize the particulars;
for it is practical, and practice is concerned with particulars. This
is why some who do not know, and especially those who have experience,
are more practical than others who know; for if a man knew that light
meats are digestible and wholesome, but did not know which sorts of
meat are light, he would not produce health, but the man who knows
that chicken is wholesome is more likely to produce health.

Now practical wisdom is concerned with action; therefore one should
have both forms of it, or the latter in preference to the former.
But of practical as of philosophic wisdom there must be a controlling
kind. 

8 

Political wisdom and practical wisdom are the same state of mind,
but their essence is not the same. Of the wisdom concerned with the
city, the practical wisdom which plays a controlling part is legislative
wisdom, while that which is related to this as particulars to their
universal is known by the general name 'political wisdom'; this has
to do with action and deliberation, for a decree is a thing to be
carried out in the form of an individual act. This is why the exponents
of this art are alone said to 'take part in politics'; for these alone
'do things' as manual labourers 'do things'. 

Practical wisdom also is identified especially with that form of it
which is concerned with a man himself-with the individual; and this
is known by the general name 'practical wisdom'; of the other kinds
one is called household management, another legislation, the third
politics, and of the latter one part is called deliberative and the
other judicial. Now knowing what is good for oneself will be one kind
of knowledge, but it is very different from the other kinds; and the
man who knows and concerns himself with his own interests is thought
to have practical wisdom, while politicians are thought to be busybodies;
hence the word of Euripides, 

But how could I be wise, who might at ease, 
Numbered among the army's multitude, 
Have had an equal share? 
For those who aim too high and do too much. Those who think thus seek
their own good, and consider that one ought to do so. From this opinion,
then, has come the view that such men have practical wisdom; yet perhaps
one's own good cannot exist without household management, nor without
a form of government. Further, how one should order one's own affairs
is not clear and needs inquiry. 

What has been said is confirmed by the fact that while young men become
geometricians and mathematicians and wise in matters like these, it
is thought that a young man of practical wisdom cannot be found. The
cause is that such wisdom is concerned not only with universals but
with particulars, which become familiar from experience, but a young
man has no experience, for it is length of time that gives experience;
indeed one might ask this question too, why a boy may become a mathematician,
but not a philosopher or a physicist. It is because the objects of
mathematics exist by abstraction, while the first principles of these
other subjects come from experience, and because young men have no
conviction about the latter but merely use the proper language, while
the essence of mathematical objects is plain enough to them?

Further, error in deliberation may be either about the universal or
about the particular; we may fall to know either that all water that
weighs heavy is bad, or that this particular water weighs heavy.

That practical wisdom is not scientific knowledge is evident; for
it is, as has been said, concerned with the ultimate particular fact,
since the thing to be done is of this nature. It is opposed, then,
to intuitive reason; for intuitive reason is of the limiting premisses,
for which no reason can be given, while practical wisdom is concerned
with the ultimate particular, which is the object not of scientific
knowledge but of perception-not the perception of qualities peculiar
to one sense but a perception akin to that by which we perceive that
the particular figure before us is a triangle; for in that direction
as well as in that of the major premiss there will be a limit. But
this is rather perception than practical wisdom, though it is another
kind of perception than that of the qualities peculiar to each sense.

There is a difference between inquiry and deliberation; for deliberation
is inquiry into a particular kind of thing. We must grasp the nature
of excellence in deliberation as well whether it is a form of scientific
knowledge, or opinion, or skill in conjecture, or some other kind
of thing. Scientific knowledge it is not; for men do not inquire about
the things they know about, but good deliberation is a kind of deliberation,
and he who deliberates inquires and calculates. Nor is it skill in
conjecture; for this both involves no reasoning and is something that
is quick in its operation, while men deliberate a long time, and they
say that one should carry out quickly the conclusions of one's deliberation,
but should deliberate slowly. Again, readiness of mind is different
from excellence in deliberation; it is a sort of skill in conjecture.
Nor again is excellence in deliberation opinion of any sort. But since
the man who deliberates badly makes a mistake, while he who deliberates
well does so correctly, excellence in deliberation is clearly a kind
of correctness, but neither of knowledge nor of opinion; for there
is no such thing as correctness of knowledge (since there is no such
thing as error of knowledge), and correctness of opinion is truth;
and at the same time everything that is an object of opinion is already
determined. But again excellence in deliberation involves reasoning.
The remaining alternative, then, is that it is correctness of thinking;
for this is not yet assertion, since, while even opinion is not inquiry
but has reached the stage of assertion, the man who is deliberating,
whether he does so well or ill, is searching for something and calculating.

But excellence in deliberation is a certain correctness of deliberation;
hence we must first inquire what deliberation is and what it is about.
And, there being more than one kind of correctness, plainly excellence
in deliberation is not any and every kind; for (1) the incontinent
man and the bad man, if he is clever, will reach as a result of his
calculation what he sets before himself, so that he will have deliberated
correctly, but he will have got for himself a great evil. Now to have
deliberated well is thought to be a good thing; for it is this kind
of correctness of deliberation that is excellence in deliberation,
viz. that which tends to attain what is good. But (2) it is possible
to attain even good by a false syllogism, and to attain what one ought
to do but not by the right means, the middle term being false; so
that this too is not yet excellence in deliberation this state in
virtue of which one attains what one ought but not by the right means.
Again (3) it is possible to attain it by long deliberation while another
man attains it quickly. Therefore in the former case we have not yet
got excellence in deliberation, which is rightness with regard to
the expedient-rightness in respect both of the end, the manner, and
the time. (4) Further it is possible to have deliberated well either
in the unqualified sense or with reference to a particular end. Excellence
in deliberation in the unqualified sense, then, is that which succeeds
with reference to what is the end in the unqualified sense, and excellence
in deliberation in a particular sense is that which succeeds relatively
to a particular end. If, then, it is characteristic of men of practical
wisdom to have deliberated well, excellence in deliberation will be
correctness with regard to what conduces to the end of which practical
wisdom is the true apprehension. 

10 

Understanding, also, and goodness of understanding, in virtue of which
men are said to be men of understanding or of good understanding,
are neither entirely the same as opinion or scientific knowledge (for
at that rate all men would have been men of understanding), nor are
they one of the particular sciences, such as medicine, the science
of things connected with health, or geometry, the science of spatial
magnitudes. For understanding is neither about things that are always
and are unchangeable, nor about any and every one of the things that
come into being, but about things which may become subjects of questioning
and deliberation. Hence it is about the same objects as practical
wisdom; but understanding and practical wisdom are not the same. For
practical wisdom issues commands, since its end is what ought to be
done or not to be done; but understanding only judges. (Understanding
is identical with goodness of understanding, men of understanding
with men of good understanding.) Now understanding is neither the
having nor the acquiring of practical wisdom; but as learning is called
understanding when it means the exercise of the faculty of knowledge,
so 'understanding' is applicable to the exercise of the faculty of
opinion for the purpose of judging of what some one else says about
matters with which practical wisdom is concerned-and of judging soundly;
for 'well' and 'soundly' are the same thing. And from this has come
the use of the name 'understanding' in virtue of which men are said
to be 'of good understanding', viz. from the application of the word
to the grasping of scientific truth; for we often call such grasping
understanding. 

11 

What is called judgement, in virtue of which men are said to 'be sympathetic
judges' and to 'have judgement', is the right discrimination of the
equitable. This is shown by the fact that we say the equitable man
is above all others a man of sympathetic judgement, and identify equity
with sympathetic judgement about certain facts. And sympathetic judgement
is judgement which discriminates what is equitable and does so correctly;
and correct judgement is that which judges what is true.

Now all the states we have considered converge, as might be expected,
to the same point; for when we speak of judgement and understanding
and practical wisdom and intuitive reason we credit the same people
with possessing judgement and having reached years of reason and with
having practical wisdom and understanding. For all these faculties
deal with ultimates, i.e. with particulars; and being a man of understanding
and of good or sympathetic judgement consists in being able judge
about the things with which practical wisdom is concerned; for the
equities are common to all good men in relation to other men. Now
all things which have to be done are included among particulars or
ultimates; for not only must the man of practical wisdom know particular
facts, but understanding and judgement are also concerned with things
to be done, and these are ultimates. And intuitive reason is concerned
with the ultimates in both directions; for both the first terms and
the last are objects of intuitive reason and not of argument, and
the intuitive reason which is presupposed by demonstrations grasps
the unchangeable and first terms, while the intuitive reason involved
in practical reasonings grasps the last and variable fact, i.e. the
minor premiss. For these variable facts are the starting-points for
the apprehension of the end, since the universals are reached from
the particulars; of these therefore we must have perception, and this
perception is intuitive reason. 

This is why these states are thought to be natural endowments-why,
while no one is thought to be a philosopher by nature, people are
thought to have by nature judgement, understanding, and intuitive
reason. This is shown by the fact that we think our powers correspond
to our time of life, and that a particular age brings with it intuitive
reason and judgement; this implies that nature is the cause. (Hence
intuitive reason is both beginning and end; for demonstrations are
from these and about these.) Therefore we ought to attend to the undemonstrated
sayings and opinions of experienced and older people or of people
of practical wisdom not less than to demonstrations; for because experience
has given them an eye they see aright. 

We have stated, then, what practical and philosophic wisdom are, and
with what each of them is concerned, and we have said that each is
the virtue of a different part of the soul. 

12 

Difficulties might be raised as to the utility of these qualities
of mind. For (1) philosophic wisdom will contemplate none of the things
that will make a man happy (for it is not concerned with any coming
into being), and though practical wisdom has this merit, for what
purpose do we need it? Practical wisdom is the quality of mind concerned
with things just and noble and good for man, but these are the things
which it is the mark of a good man to do, and we are none the more
able to act for knowing them if the virtues are states of character,
just as we are none the better able to act for knowing the things
that are healthy and sound, in the sense not of producing but of issuing
from the state of health; for we are none the more able to act for
having the art of medicine or of gymnastics. But (2) if we are to
say that a man should have practical wisdom not for the sake of knowing
moral truths but for the sake of becoming good, practical wisdom will
be of no use to those who are good; again it is of no use to those
who have not virtue; for it will make no difference whether they have
practical wisdom themselves or obey others who have it, and it would
be enough for us to do what we do in the case of health; though we
wish to become healthy, yet we do not learn the art of medicine. (3)
Besides this, it would be thought strange if practical wisdom, being
inferior to philosophic wisdom, is to be put in authority over it,
as seems to be implied by the fact that the art which produces anything
rules and issues commands about that thing. 

These, then, are the questions we must discuss; so far we have only
stated the difficulties. 

(1) Now first let us say that in themselves these states must be worthy
of choice because they are the virtues of the two parts of the soul
respectively, even if neither of them produce anything. 

(2) Secondly, they do produce something, not as the art of medicine
produces health, however, but as health produces health; so does philosophic
wisdom produce happiness; for, being a part of virtue entire, by being
possessed and by actualizing itself it makes a man happy.

(3) Again, the work of man is achieved only in accordance with practical
wisdom as well as with moral virtue; for virtue makes us aim at the
right mark, and practical wisdom makes us take the right means. (Of
the fourth part of the soul-the nutritive-there is no such virtue;
for there is nothing which it is in its power to do or not to do., 4) With regard to our being none the more able to do because of our
practical wisdom what is noble and just, let us begin a little further
back, starting with the following principle. As we say that some people
who do just acts are not necessarily just, i.e. those who do the acts
ordained by the laws either unwillingly or owing to ignorance or for
some other reason and not for the sake of the acts themselves (though,
to be sure, they do what they should and all the things that the good
man ought), so is it, it seems, that in order to be good one must
be in a certain state when one does the several acts, i.e. one must
do them as a result of choice and for the sake of the acts themselves.
Now virtue makes the choice right, but the question of the things
which should naturally be done to carry out our choice belongs not
to virtue but to another faculty. We must devote our attention to
these matters and give a clearer statement about them. There is a
faculty which is called cleverness; and this is such as to be able
to do the things that tend towards the mark we have set before ourselves,
and to hit it. Now if the mark be noble, the cleverness is laudable,
but if the mark be bad, the cleverness is mere smartness; hence we
call even men of practical wisdom clever or smart. Practical wisdom
is not the faculty, but it does not exist without this faculty. And
this eye of the soul acquires its formed state not without the aid
of virtue, as has been said and is plain; for the syllogisms which
deal with acts to be done are things which involve a starting-point,
viz. 'since the end, i.e. what is best, is of such and such a nature',
whatever it may be (let it for the sake of argument be what we please);
and this is not evident except to the good man; for wickedness perverts
us and causes us to be deceived about the starting-points of action.
Therefore it is evident that it is impossible to be practically wise
without being good. 

13 

We must therefore consider virtue also once more; for virtue too is
similarly related; as practical wisdom is to cleverness-not the same,
but like it-so is natural virtue to virtue in the strict sense. For
all men think that each type of character belongs to its possessors
in some sense by nature; for from the very moment of birth we are
just or fitted for selfcontrol or brave or have the other moral qualities;
but yet we seek something else as that which is good in the strict
sense-we seek for the presence of such qualities in another way. For
both children and brutes have the natural dispositions to these qualities,
but without reason these are evidently hurtful. Only we seem to see
this much, that, while one may be led astray by them, as a strong
body which moves without sight may stumble badly because of its lack
of sight, still, if a man once acquires reason, that makes a difference
in action; and his state, while still like what it was, will then
be virtue in the strict sense. Therefore, as in the part of us which
forms opinions there are two types, cleverness and practical wisdom,
so too in the moral part there are two types, natural virtue and virtue
in the strict sense, and of these the latter involves practical wisdom.
This is why some say that all the virtues are forms of practical wisdom,
and why Socrates in one respect was on the right track while in another
he went astray; in thinking that all the virtues were forms of practical
wisdom he was wrong, but in saying they implied practical wisdom he
was right. This is confirmed by the fact that even now all men, when
they define virtue, after naming the state of character and its objects
add 'that (state) which is in accordance with the right rule'; now
the right rule is that which is in accordance with practical wisdom.
All men, then, seem somehow to divine that this kind of state is virtue,
viz. that which is in accordance with practical wisdom. But we must
go a little further. For it is not merely the state in accordance
with the right rule, but the state that implies the presence of the
right rule, that is virtue; and practical wisdom is a right rule about
such matters. Socrates, then, thought the virtues were rules or rational
principles (for he thought they were, all of them, forms of scientific
knowledge), while we think they involve a rational principle.

It is clear, then, from what has been said, that it is not possible
to be good in the strict sense without practical wisdom, nor practically
wise without moral virtue. But in this way we may also refute the
dialectical argument whereby it might be contended that the virtues
exist in separation from each other; the same man, it might be said,
is not best equipped by nature for all the virtues, so that he will
have already acquired one when he has not yet acquired another. This
is possible in respect of the natural virtues, but not in respect
of those in respect of which a man is called without qualification
good; for with the presence of the one quality, practical wisdom,
will be given all the virtues. And it is plain that, even if it were
of no practical value, we should have needed it because it is the
virtue of the part of us in question; plain too that the choice will
not be right without practical wisdom any more than without virtue;
for the one deter, mines the end and the other makes us do the things
that lead to the end. 

But again it is not supreme over philosophic wisdom, i.e. over the
superior part of us, any more than the art of medicine is over health;
for it does not use it but provides for its coming into being; it
issues orders, then, for its sake, but not to it. Further, to maintain
its supremacy would be like saying that the art of politics rules
the gods because it issues orders about all the affairs of the state.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK VII

1 

Let us now make a fresh beginning and point out that of moral states
to be avoided there are three kinds-vice, incontinence, brutishness.
The contraries of two of these are evident,-one we call virtue, the
other continence; to brutishness it would be most fitting to oppose
superhuman virtue, a heroic and divine kind of virtue, as Homer has
represented Priam saying of Hector that he was very good,

For he seemed not, he, 
The child of a mortal man, but as one that of God's seed came.

Therefore if, as they say, men become gods by excess of virtue, of
this kind must evidently be the state opposed to the brutish state;
for as a brute has no vice or virtue, so neither has a god; his state
is higher than virtue, and that of a brute is a different kind of
state from vice. 

Now, since it is rarely that a godlike man is found-to use the epithet
of the Spartans, who when they admire any one highly call him a 'godlike
man'-so too the brutish type is rarely found among men; it is found
chiefly among barbarians, but some brutish qualities are also produced
by disease or deformity; and we also call by this evil name those
men who go beyond all ordinary standards by reason of vice. Of this
kind of disposition, however, we must later make some mention, while
we have discussed vice before we must now discuss incontinence and
softness (or effeminacy), and continence and endurance; for we must
treat each of the two neither as identical with virtue or wickedness,
nor as a different genus. We must, as in all other cases, set the
observed facts before us and, after first discussing the difficulties,
go on to prove, if possible, the truth of all the common opinions
about these affections of the mind, or, failing this, of the greater
number and the most authoritative; for if we both refute the objections
and leave the common opinions undisturbed, we shall have proved the
case sufficiently. 

Now (1) both continence and endurance are thought to be included among
things good and praiseworthy, and both incontinence and soft, ness
among things bad and blameworthy; and the same man is thought to be
continent and ready to abide by the result of his calculations, or
incontinent and ready to abandon them. And (2) the incontinent man,
knowing that what he does is bad, does it as a result of passion,
while the continent man, knowing that his appetites are bad, refuses
on account of his rational principle to follow them (3) The temperate
man all men call continent and disposed to endurance, while the continent
man some maintain to be always temperate but others do not; and some
call the self-indulgent man incontinent and the incontinent man selfindulgent
indiscriminately, while others distinguish them. (4) The man of practical
wisdom, they sometimes say, cannot be incontinent, while sometimes
they say that some who are practically wise and clever are incontinent.
Again (5) men are said to be incontinent even with respect to anger,
honour, and gain.-These, then, are the things that are said.

2 

Now we may ask (1) how a man who judges rightly can behave incontinently.
That he should behave so when he has knowledge, some say is impossible;
for it would be strange-so Socrates thought-if when knowledge was
in a man something else could master it and drag it about like a slave.
For Socrates was entirely opposed to the view in question, holding
that there is no such thing as incontinence; no one, he said, when
he judges acts against what he judges best-people act so only by reason
of ignorance. Now this view plainly contradicts the observed facts,
and we must inquire about what happens to such a man; if he acts by
reason of ignorance, what is the manner of his ignorance? For that
the man who behaves incontinently does not, before he gets into this
state, think he ought to act so, is evident. But there are some who
concede certain of Socrates' contentions but not others; that nothing
is stronger than knowledge they admit, but not that on one acts contrary
to what has seemed to him the better course, and therefore they say
that the incontinent man has not knowledge when he is mastered by
his pleasures, but opinion. But if it is opinion and not knowledge,
if it is not a strong conviction that resists but a weak one, as in
men who hesitate, we sympathize with their failure to stand by such
convictions against strong appetites; but we do not sympathize with
wickedness, nor with any of the other blameworthy states. Is it then
practical wisdom whose resistance is mastered? That is the strongest
of all states. But this is absurd; the same man will be at once practically
wise and incontinent, but no one would say that it is the part of
a practically wise man to do willingly the basest acts. Besides, it
has been shown before that the man of practical wisdom is one who
will act (for he is a man concerned with the individual facts) and
who has the other virtues. 

(2) Further, if continence involves having strong and bad appetites,
the temperate man will not be continent nor the continent man temperate;
for a temperate man will have neither excessive nor bad appetites.
But the continent man must; for if the appetites are good, the state
of character that restrains us from following them is bad, so that
not all continence will be good; while if they are weak and not bad,
there is nothing admirable in resisting them, and if they are weak
and bad, there is nothing great in resisting these either.

(3) Further, if continence makes a man ready to stand by any and every
opinion, it is bad, i.e. if it makes him stand even by a false opinion;
and if incontinence makes a man apt to abandon any and every opinion,
there will be a good incontinence, of which Sophocles' Neoptolemus
in the Philoctetes will be an instance; for he is to be praised for
not standing by what Odysseus persuaded him to do, because he is pained
at telling a lie. 

(4) Further, the sophistic argument presents a difficulty; the syllogism
arising from men's wish to expose paradoxical results arising from
an opponent's view, in order that they may be admired when they succeed,
is one that puts us in a difficulty (for thought is bound fast when
it will not rest because the conclusion does not satisfy it, and cannot
advance because it cannot refute the argument). There is an argument
from which it follows that folly coupled with incontinence is virtue;
for a man does the opposite of what he judges, owing to incontinence,
but judges what is good to be evil and something that he should not
do, and consequence he will do what is good and not what is evil.

(5) Further, he who on conviction does and pursues and chooses what
is pleasant would be thought to be better than one who does so as
a result not of calculation but of incontinence; for he is easier
to cure since he may be persuaded to change his mind. But to the incontinent
man may be applied the proverb 'when water chokes, what is one to
wash it down with?' If he had been persuaded of the rightness of what
he does, he would have desisted when he was persuaded to change his
mind; but now he acts in spite of his being persuaded of something
quite different. 

(6) Further, if incontinence and continence are concerned with any
and every kind of object, who is it that is incontinent in the unqualified
sense? No one has all the forms of incontinence, but we say some people
are incontinent without qualification. 

3 

Of some such kind are the difficulties that arise; some of these points
must be refuted and the others left in possession of the field; for
the solution of the difficulty is the discovery of the truth. (1)
We must consider first, then, whether incontinent people act knowingly
or not, and in what sense knowingly; then (2) with what sorts of object
the incontinent and the continent man may be said to be concerned
(i.e. whether with any and every pleasure and pain or with certain
determinate kinds), and whether the continent man and the man of endurance
are the same or different; and similarly with regard to the other
matters germane to this inquiry. The starting-point of our investigation
is (a) the question whether the continent man and the incontinent
are differentiated by their objects or by their attitude, i.e. whether
the incontinent man is incontinent simply by being concerned with
such and such objects, or, instead, by his attitude, or, instead of
that, by both these things; (b) the second question is whether incontinence
and continence are concerned with any and every object or not. The
man who is incontinent in the unqualified sense is neither concerned
with any and every object, but with precisely those with which the
self-indulgent man is concerned, nor is he characterized by being
simply related to these (for then his state would be the same as self-indulgence),
but by being related to them in a certain way. For the one is led
on in accordance with his own choice, thinking that he ought always
to pursue the present pleasure; while the other does not think so,
but yet pursues it. 

(1) As for the suggestion that it is true opinion and not knowledge
against which we act incontinently, that makes no difference to the
argument; for some people when in a state of opinion do not hesitate,
but think they know exactly. If, then, the notion is that owing to
their weak conviction those who have opinion are more likely to act
against their judgement than those who know, we answer that there
need be no difference between knowledge and opinion in this respect;
for some men are no less convinced of what they think than others
of what they know; as is shown by the of Heraclitus. But (a), since
we use the word 'know' in two senses (for both the man who has knowledge
but is not using it and he who is using it are said to know), it will
make a difference whether, when a man does what he should not, he
has the knowledge but is not exercising it, or is exercising it; for
the latter seems strange, but not the former. 

(b) Further, since there are two kinds of premisses, there is nothing
to prevent a man's having both premisses and acting against his knowledge,
provided that he is using only the universal premiss and not the particular;
for it is particular acts that have to be done. And there are also
two kinds of universal term; one is predicable of the agent, the other
of the object; e.g. 'dry food is good for every man', and 'I am a
man', or 'such and such food is dry'; but whether 'this food is such
and such', of this the incontinent man either has not or is not exercising
the knowledge. There will, then, be, firstly, an enormous difference
between these manners of knowing, so that to know in one way when
we act incontinently would not seem anything strange, while to know
in the other way would be extraordinary. 

And further (c) the possession of knowledge in another sense than
those just named is something that happens to men; for within the
case of having knowledge but not using it we see a difference of state,
admitting of the possibility of having knowledge in a sense and yet
not having it, as in the instance of a man asleep, mad, or drunk.
But now this is just the condition of men under the influence of passions;
for outbursts of anger and sexual appetites and some other such passions,
it is evident, actually alter our bodily condition, and in some men
even produce fits of madness. It is plain, then, that incontinent
people must be said to be in a similar condition to men asleep, mad,
or drunk. The fact that men use the language that flows from knowledge
proves nothing; for even men under the influence of these passions
utter scientific proofs and verses of Empedocles, and those who have
just begun to learn a science can string together its phrases, but
do not yet know it; for it has to become part of themselves, and that
takes time; so that we must suppose that the use of language by men
in an incontinent state means no more than its utterance by actors
on the stage. (d) Again, we may also view the cause as follows with
reference to the facts of human nature. The one opinion is universal,
the other is concerned with the particular facts, and here we come
to something within the sphere of perception; when a single opinion
results from the two, the soul must in one type of case affirm the
conclusion, while in the case of opinions concerned with production
it must immediately act (e.g. if 'everything sweet ought to be tasted',
and 'this is sweet', in the sense of being one of the particular sweet
things, the man who can act and is not prevented must at the same
time actually act accordingly). When, then, the universal opinion
is present in us forbidding us to taste, and there is also the opinion
that 'everything sweet is pleasant', and that 'this is sweet' (now
this is the opinion that is active), and when appetite happens to
be present in us, the one opinion bids us avoid the object, but appetite
leads us towards it (for it can move each of our bodily parts); so
that it turns out that a man behaves incontinently under the influence
(in a sense) of a rule and an opinion, and of one not contrary in
itself, but only incidentally-for the appetite is contrary, not the
opinion-to the right rule. It also follows that this is the reason
why the lower animals are not incontinent, viz. because they have
no universal judgement but only imagination and memory of particulars.

The explanation of how the ignorance is dissolved and the incontinent
man regains his knowledge, is the same as in the case of the man drunk
or asleep and is not peculiar to this condition; we must go to the
students of natural science for it. Now, the last premiss both being
an opinion about a perceptible object, and being what determines our
actions this a man either has not when he is in the state of passion,
or has it in the sense in which having knowledge did not mean knowing
but only talking, as a drunken man may utter the verses of Empedocles.
And because the last term is not universal nor equally an object of
scientific knowledge with the universal term, the position that Socrates
sought to establish actually seems to result; for it is not in the
presence of what is thought to be knowledge proper that the affection
of incontinence arises (nor is it this that is 'dragged about' as
a result of the state of passion), but in that of perceptual knowledge.

This must suffice as our answer to the question of action with and
without knowledge, and how it is possible to behave incontinently
with knowledge. 

4 

(2) We must next discuss whether there is any one who is incontinent
without qualification, or all men who are incontinent are so in a
particular sense, and if there is, with what sort of objects he is
concerned. That both continent persons and persons of endurance, and
incontinent and soft persons, are concerned with pleasures and pains,
is evident. 

Now of the things that produce pleasure some are necessary, while
others are worthy of choice in themselves but admit of excess, the
bodily causes of pleasure being necessary (by such I mean both those
concerned with food and those concerned with sexual intercourse, i.e.
the bodily matters with which we defined self-indulgence and temperance
as being concerned), while the others are not necessary but worthy
of choice in themselves (e.g. victory, honour, wealth, and good and
pleasant things of this sort). This being so, (a) those who go to
excess with reference to the latter, contrary to the right rule which
is in themselves, are not called incontinent simply, but incontinent
with the qualification 'in respect of money, gain, honour, or anger',-not
simply incontinent, on the ground that they are different from incontinent
people and are called incontinent by reason of a resemblance. (Compare
the case of Anthropos (Man), who won a contest at the Olympic games;
in his case the general definition of man differed little from the
definition peculiar to him, but yet it was different.) This is shown
by the fact that incontinence either without qualification or in respect
of some particular bodily pleasure is blamed not only as a fault but
as a kind of vice, while none of the people who are incontinent in
these other respects is so blamed. 

But (b) of the people who are incontinent with respect to bodily enjoyments,
with which we say the temperate and the self-indulgent man are concerned,
he who pursues the excesses of things pleasant-and shuns those of
things painful, of hunger and thirst and heat and cold and all the
objects of touch and taste-not by choice but contrary to his choice
and his judgement, is called incontinent, not with the qualification
'in respect of this or that', e.g. of anger, but just simply. This
is confirmed by the fact that men are called 'soft' with regard to
these pleasures, but not with regard to any of the others. And for
this reason we group together the incontinent and the self-indulgent,
the continent and the temperate man-but not any of these other types-because
they are concerned somehow with the same pleasures and pains; but
though these are concerned with the same objects, they are not similarly
related to them, but some of them make a deliberate choice while the
others do not. 

This is why we should describe as self-indulgent rather the man who
without appetite or with but a slight appetite pursues the excesses
of pleasure and avoids moderate pains, than the man who does so because
of his strong appetites; for what would the former do, if he had in
addition a vigorous appetite, and a violent pain at the lack of the
'necessary' objects? 

Now of appetites and pleasures some belong to the class of things
generically noble and good-for some pleasant things are by nature
worthy of choice, while others are contrary to these, and others are
intermediate, to adopt our previous distinction-e.g. wealth, gain,
victory, honour. And with reference to all objects whether of this
or of the intermediate kind men are not blamed for being affected
by them, for desiring and loving them, but for doing so in a certain
way, i.e. for going to excess. (This is why all those who contrary
to the rule either are mastered by or pursue one of the objects which
are naturally noble and good, e.g. those who busy themselves more
than they ought about honour or about children and parents, (are not
wicked); for these too are good, and those who busy themselves about
them are praised; but yet there is an excess even in them-if like
Niobe one were to fight even against the gods, or were to be as much
devoted to one's father as Satyrus nicknamed 'the filial', who was
thought to be very silly on this point.) There is no wickedness, then,
with regard to these objects, for the reason named, viz. because each
of them is by nature a thing worthy of choice for its own sake; yet
excesses in respect of them are bad and to be avoided. Similarly there
is no incontinence with regard to them; for incontinence is not only
to be avoided but is also a thing worthy of blame; but owing to a
similarity in the state of feeling people apply the name incontinence,
adding in each case what it is in respect of, as we may describe as
a bad doctor or a bad actor one whom we should not call bad, simply.
As, then, in this case we do not apply the term without qualification
because each of these conditions is no shadness but only analogous
to it, so it is clear that in the other case also that alone must
be taken to be incontinence and continence which is concerned with
the same objects as temperance and self-indulgence, but we apply the
term to anger by virtue of a resemblance; and this is why we say with
a qualification 'incontinent in respect of anger' as we say 'incontinent
in respect of honour, or of gain'.

(1) Some things are pleasant by nature, and of these (a) some are
so without qualification, and (b) others are so with reference to
particular classes either of animals or of men; while (2) others are
not pleasant by nature, but (a) some of them become so by reason of
injuries to the system, and (b) others by reason of acquired habits,
and (c) others by reason of originally bad natures. This being so,
it is possible with regard to each of the latter kinds to discover
similar states of character to those recognized with regard to the
former; I mean (A) the brutish states, as in the case of the female
who, they say, rips open pregnant women and devours the infants, or
of the things in which some of the tribes about the Black Sea that
have gone savage are said to delight-in raw meat or in human flesh,
or in lending their children to one another to feast upon-or of the
story told of Phalaris. 

These states are brutish, but (B) others arise as a result of disease
(or, in some cases, of madness, as with the man who sacrificed and
ate his mother, or with the slave who ate the liver of his fellow),
and others are morbid states (C) resulting from custom, e.g. the habit
of plucking out the hair or of gnawing the nails, or even coals or
earth, and in addition to these paederasty; for these arise in some
by nature and in others, as in those who have been the victims of
lust from childhood, from habit. 

Now those in whom nature is the cause of such a state no one would
call incontinent, any more than one would apply the epithet to women
because of the passive part they play in copulation; nor would one
apply it to those who are in a morbid condition as a result of habit.
To have these various types of habit is beyond the limits of vice,
as brutishness is too; for a man who has them to master or be mastered
by them is not simple (continence or) incontinence but that which
is so by analogy, as the man who is in this condition in respect of
fits of anger is to be called incontinent in respect of that feeling
but not incontinent simply. For every excessive state whether of folly,
of cowardice, of self-indulgence, or of bad temper, is either brutish
or morbid; the man who is by nature apt to fear everything, even the
squeak of a mouse, is cowardly with a brutish cowardice, while the
man who feared a weasel did so in consequence of disease; and of foolish
people those who by nature are thoughtless and live by their senses
alone are brutish, like some races of the distant barbarians, while
those who are so as a result of disease (e.g. of epilepsy) or of madness
are morbid. Of these characteristics it is possible to have some only
at times, and not to be mastered by them. e.g. Phalaris may have restrained
a desire to eat the flesh of a child or an appetite for unnatural
sexual pleasure; but it is also possible to be mastered, not merely
to have the feelings. Thus, as the wickedness which is on the human
level is called wickedness simply, while that which is not is called
wickedness not simply but with the qualification 'brutish' or 'morbid',
in the same way it is plain that some incontinence is brutish and
some morbid, while only that which corresponds to human self-indulgence
is incontinence simply. 

That incontinence and continence, then, are concerned only with the
same objects as selfindulgence and temperance and that what is concerned
with other objects is a type distinct from incontinence, and called
incontinence by a metaphor and not simply, is plain. 

6 

That incontinence in respect of anger is less disgraceful than that
in respect of the appetites is what we will now proceed to see. (1)
Anger seems to listen to argument to some extent, but to mishear it,
as do hasty servants who run out before they have heard the whole
of what one says, and then muddle the order, or as dogs bark if there
is but a knock at the door, before looking to see if it is a friend;
so anger by reason of the warmth and hastiness of its nature, though
it hears, does not hear an order, and springs to take revenge. For
argument or imagination informs us that we have been insulted or slighted,
and anger, reasoning as it were that anything like this must be fought
against, boils up straightway; while appetite, if argument or perception
merely says that an object is pleasant, springs to the enjoyment of
it. Therefore anger obeys the argument in a sense, but appetite does
not. It is therefore more disgraceful; for the man who is incontinent
in respect of anger is in a sense conquered by argument, while the
other is conquered by appetite and not by argument. 

(2) Further, we pardon people more easily for following natural desires,
since we pardon them more easily for following such appetites as are
common to all men, and in so far as they are common; now anger and
bad temper are more natural than the appetites for excess, i.e. for
unnecessary objects. Take for instance the man who defended himself
on the charge of striking his father by saying 'yes, but he struck
his father, and he struck his, and' (pointing to his child) 'this
boy will strike me when he is a man; it runs in the family'; or the
man who when he was being dragged along by his son bade him stop at
the doorway, since he himself had dragged his father only as far as
that. 

(2) Further, those who are more given to plotting against others are
more criminal. Now a passionate man is not given to plotting, nor
is anger itself-it is open; but the nature of appetite is illustrated
by what the poets call Aphrodite, 'guile-weaving daughter of Cyprus',
and by Homer's words about her 'embroidered girdle': 

And the whisper of wooing is there, 
Whose subtlety stealeth the wits of the wise, how prudent soe'er.
Therefore if this form of incontinence is more criminal and disgraceful
than that in respect of anger, it is both incontinence without qualification
and in a sense vice. 

(4) Further, no one commits wanton outrage with a feeling of pain,
but every one who acts in anger acts with pain, while the man who
commits outrage acts with pleasure. If, then, those acts at which
it is most just to be angry are more criminal than others, the incontinence
which is due to appetite is the more criminal; for there is no wanton
outrage involved in anger. 

Plainly, then, the incontinence concerned with appetite is more disgraceful
than that concerned with anger, and continence and incontinence are
concerned with bodily appetites and pleasures; but we must grasp the
differences among the latter themselves. For, as has been said at
the beginning, some are human and natural both in kind and in magnitude,
others are brutish, and others are due to organic injuries and diseases.
Only with the first of these are temperance and self-indulgence concerned;
this is why we call the lower animals neither temperate nor self-indulgent
except by a metaphor, and only if some one race of animals exceeds
another as a whole in wantonness, destructiveness, and omnivorous
greed; these have no power of choice or calculation, but they are
departures from the natural norm, as, among men, madmen are. Now brutishness
is a less evil than vice, though more alarming; for it is not that
the better part has been perverted, as in man,-they have no better
part. Thus it is like comparing a lifeless thing with a living in
respect of badness; for the badness of that which has no originative
source of movement is always less hurtful, and reason is an originative
source. Thus it is like comparing injustice in the abstract with an
unjust man. Each is in some sense worse; for a bad man will do ten
thousand times as much evil as a brute. 

7 

With regard to the pleasures and pains and appetites and aversions
arising through touch and taste, to which both self-indulgence and
temperance were formerly narrowed down, it possible to be in such
a state as to be defeated even by those of them which most people
master, or to master even those by which most people are defeated;
among these possibilities, those relating to pleasures are incontinence
and continence, those relating to pains softness and endurance. The
state of most people is intermediate, even if they lean more towards
the worse states. 

Now, since some pleasures are necessary while others are not, and
are necessary up to a point while the excesses of them are not, nor
the deficiencies, and this is equally true of appetites and pains,
the man who pursues the excesses of things pleasant, or pursues to
excess necessary objects, and does so by choice, for their own sake
and not at all for the sake of any result distinct from them, is self-indulgent;
for such a man is of necessity unlikely to repent, and therefore incurable,
since a man who cannot repent cannot be cured. The man who is deficient
in his pursuit of them is the opposite of self-indulgent; the man
who is intermediate is temperate. Similarly, there is the man who
avoids bodily pains not because he is defeated by them but by choice.
(Of those who do not choose such acts, one kind of man is led to them
as a result of the pleasure involved, another because he avoids the
pain arising from the appetite, so that these types differ from one
another. Now any one would think worse of a man with no appetite or
with weak appetite were he to do something disgraceful, than if he
did it under the influence of powerful appetite, and worse of him
if he struck a blow not in anger than if he did it in anger; for what
would he have done if he had been strongly affected? This is why the
self-indulgent man is worse than the incontinent.) of the states named,
then, the latter is rather a kind of softness; the former is self-indulgence.
While to the incontinent man is opposed the continent, to the soft
is opposed the man of endurance; for endurance consists in resisting,
while continence consists in conquering, and resisting and conquering
are different, as not being beaten is different from winning; this
is why continence is also more worthy of choice than endurance. Now
the man who is defective in respect of resistance to the things which
most men both resist and resist successfully is soft and effeminate;
for effeminacy too is a kind of softness; such a man trails his cloak
to avoid the pain of lifting it, and plays the invalid without thinking
himself wretched, though the man he imitates is a wretched man.

The case is similar with regard to continence and incontinence. For
if a man is defeated by violent and excessive pleasures or pains,
there is nothing wonderful in that; indeed we are ready to pardon
him if he has resisted, as Theodectes' Philoctetes does when bitten
by the snake, or Carcinus' Cercyon in the Alope, and as people who
try to restrain their laughter burst out into a guffaw, as happened
to Xenophantus. But it is surprising if a man is defeated by and cannot
resist pleasures or pains which most men can hold out against, when
this is not due to heredity or disease, like the softness that is
hereditary with the kings of the Scythians, or that which distinguishes
the female sex from the male. 

The lover of amusement, too, is thought to be self-indulgent, but
is really soft. For amusement is a relaxation, since it is a rest
from work; and the lover of amusement is one of the people who go
to excess in this. 

Of incontinence one kind is impetuosity, another weakness. For some
men after deliberating fail, owing to their emotion, to stand by the
conclusions of their deliberation, others because they have not deliberated
are led by their emotion; since some men (just as people who first
tickle others are not tickled themselves), if they have first perceived
and seen what is coming and have first roused themselves and their
calculative faculty, are not defeated by their emotion, whether it
be pleasant or painful. It is keen and excitable people that suffer
especially from the impetuous form of incontinence; for the former
by reason of their quickness and the latter by reason of the violence
of their passions do not await the argument, because they are apt
to follow their imagination. 

8 

The self-indulgent man, as was said, is not apt to repent; for he
stands by his choice; but incontinent man is likely to repent. This
is why the position is not as it was expressed in the formulation
of the problem, but the selfindulgent man is incurable and the incontinent
man curable; for wickedness is like a disease such as dropsy or consumption,
while incontinence is like epilepsy; the former is a permanent, the
latter an intermittent badness. And generally incontinence and vice
are different in kind; vice is unconscious of itself, incontinence
is not (of incontinent men themselves, those who become temporarily
beside themselves are better than those who have the rational principle
but do not abide by it, since the latter are defeated by a weaker
passion, and do not act without previous deliberation like the others);
for the incontinent man is like the people who get drunk quickly and
on little wine, i.e. on less than most people. 

Evidently, then, incontinence is not vice (though perhaps it is so
in a qualified sense); for incontinence is contrary to choice while
vice is in accordance with choice; not but what they are similar in
respect of the actions they lead to; as in the saying of Demodocus
about the Milesians, 'the Milesians are not without sense, but they
do the things that senseless people do', so too incontinent people
are not criminal, but they will do criminal acts. 

Now, since the incontinent man is apt to pursue, not on conviction,
bodily pleasures that are excessive and contrary to the right rule,
while the self-indulgent man is convinced because he is the sort of
man to pursue them, it is on the contrary the former that is easily
persuaded to change his mind, while the latter is not. For virtue
and vice respectively preserve and destroy the first principle, and
in actions the final cause is the first principle, as the hypotheses
are in mathematics; neither in that case is it argument that teaches
the first principles, nor is it so here-virtue either natural or produced
by habituation is what teaches right opinion about the first principle.
Such a man as this, then, is temperate; his contrary is the self-indulgent.

But there is a sort of man who is carried away as a result of passion
and contrary to the right rule-a man whom passion masters so that
he does not act according to the right rule, but does not master to
the extent of making him ready to believe that he ought to pursue
such pleasures without reserve; this is the incontinent man, who is
better than the self-indulgent man, and not bad without qualification;
for the best thing in him, the first principle, is preserved. And
contrary to him is another kind of man, he who abides by his convictions
and is not carried away, at least as a result of passion. It is evident
from these considerations that the latter is a good state and the
former a bad one. 

9 

Is the man continent who abides by any and every rule and any and
every choice, or the man who abides by the right choice, and is he
incontinent who abandons any and every choice and any and every rule,
or he who abandons the rule that is not false and the choice that
is right; this is how we put it before in our statement of the problem.
Or is it incidentally any and every choice but per se the true rule
and the right choice by which the one abides and the other does not?
If any one chooses or pursues this for the sake of that, per se he
pursues and chooses the latter, but incidentally the former. But when
we speak without qualification we mean what is per se. Therefore in
a sense the one abides by, and the other abandons, any and every opinion;
but without qualification, the true opinion. 

There are some who are apt to abide by their opinion, who are called
strong-headed, viz. those who are hard to persuade in the first instance
and are not easily persuaded to change; these have in them something
like the continent man, as the prodigal is in a way like the liberal
man and the rash man like the confident man; but they are different
in many respects. For it is to passion and appetite that the one will
not yield, since on occasion the continent man will be easy to persuade;
but it is to argument that the others refuse to yield, for they do
form appetites and many of them are led by their pleasures. Now the
people who are strong-headed are the opinionated, the ignorant, and
the boorish-the opinionated being influenced by pleasure and pain;
for they delight in the victory they gain if they are not persuaded
to change, and are pained if their decisions become null and void
as decrees sometimes do; so that they are liker the incontinent than
the continent man. 

But there are some who fail to abide by their resolutions, not as
a result of incontinence, e.g. Neoptolemus in Sophocles' Philoctetes;
yet it was for the sake of pleasure that he did not stand fast-but
a noble pleasure; for telling the truth was noble to him, but he had
been persuaded by Odysseus to tell the lie. For not every one who
does anything for the sake of pleasure is either self-indulgent or
bad or incontinent, but he who does it for a disgraceful pleasure.

Since there is also a sort of man who takes less delight than he should
in bodily things, and does not abide by the rule, he who is intermediate
between him and the incontinent man is the continent man; for the
incontinent man fails to abide by the rule because he delights too
much in them, and this man because he delights in them too little;
while the continent man abides by the rule and does not change on
either account. Now if continence is good, both the contrary states
must be bad, as they actually appear to be; but because the other
extreme is seen in few people and seldom, as temperance is thought
to be contrary only to self-indulgence, so is continence to incontinence.

Since many names are applied analogically, it is by analogy that we
have come to speak of the 'continence' the temperate man; for both
the continent man and the temperate man are such as to do nothing
contrary to the rule for the sake of the bodily pleasures, but the
former has and the latter has not bad appetites, and the latter is
such as not to feel pleasure contrary to the rule, while the former
is such as to feel pleasure but not to be led by it. And the incontinent
and the self-indulgent man are also like another; they are different,
but both pursue bodily pleasures- the latter, however, also thinking
that he ought to do so, while the former does not think this.

10 

Nor can the same man have practical wisdom and be incontinent; for
it has been shown' that a man is at the same time practically wise,
and good in respect of character. Further, a man has practical wisdom
not by knowing only but by being able to act; but the incontinent
man is unable to act-there is, however, nothing to prevent a clever
man from being incontinent; this is why it is sometimes actually thought
that some people have practical wisdom but are incontinent, viz. because
cleverness and practical wisdom differ in the way we have described
in our first discussions, and are near together in respect of their
reasoning, but differ in respect of their purpose-nor yet is the incontinent
man like the man who knows and is contemplating a truth, but like
the man who is asleep or drunk. And he acts willingly (for he acts
in a sense with knowledge both of what he does and of the end to which
he does it), but is not wicked, since his purpose is good; so that
he is half-wicked. And he is not a criminal; for he does not act of
malice aforethought; of the two types of incontinent man the one does
not abide by the conclusions of his deliberation, while the excitable
man does not deliberate at all. And thus the incontinent man like
a city which passes all the right decrees and has good laws, but makes
no use of them, as in Anaxandrides' jesting remark, 

The city willed it, that cares nought for laws; but the wicked man
is like a city that uses its laws, but has wicked laws to use.

Now incontinence and continence are concerned with that which is in
excess of the state characteristic of most men; for the continent
man abides by his resolutions more and the incontinent man less than
most men can. 

Of the forms of incontinence, that of excitable people is more curable
than that of those who deliberate but do not abide by their decisions,
and those who are incontinent through habituation are more curable
than those in whom incontinence is innate; for it is easier to change
a habit than to change one's nature; even habit is hard to change
just because it is like nature, as Evenus says: 

I say that habit's but a long practice, friend, 
And this becomes men's nature in the end. 

We have now stated what continence, incontinence, endurance, and softness
are, and how these states are related to each other. 

11 

The study of pleasure and pain belongs to the province of the political
philosopher; for he is the architect of the end, with a view to which
we call one thing bad and another good without qualification. Further,
it is one of our necessary tasks to consider them; for not only did
we lay it down that moral virtue and vice are concerned with pains
and pleasures, but most people say that happiness involves pleasure;
this is why the blessed man is called by a name derived from a word
meaning enjoyment. 

Now (1) some people think that no pleasure is a good, either in itself
or incidentally, since the good and pleasure are not the same; (2)
others think that some pleasures are good but that most are bad. (3)
Again there is a third view, that even if all pleasures are good,
yet the best thing in the world cannot be pleasure. (1) The reasons
given for the view that pleasure is not a good at all are (a) that
every pleasure is a perceptible process to a natural state, and that
no process is of the same kind as its end, e.g. no process of building
of the same kind as a house. (b) A temperate man avoids pleasures.
(c) A man of practical wisdom pursues what is free from pain, not
what is pleasant. (d) The pleasures are a hindrance to thought, and
the more so the more one delights in them, e.g. in sexual pleasure;
for no one could think of anything while absorbed in this. (e) There
is no art of pleasure; but every good is the product of some art.
(f) Children and the brutes pursue pleasures. (2) The reasons for
the view that not all pleasures are good are that (a) there are pleasures
that are actually base and objects of reproach, and (b) there are
harmful pleasures; for some pleasant things are unhealthy. (3) The
reason for the view that the best thing in the world is not pleasure
is that pleasure is not an end but a process. 

12 

These are pretty much the things that are said. That it does not follow
from these grounds that pleasure is not a good, or even the chief
good, is plain from the following considerations. (A, a) First, since
that which is good may be so in either of two senses (one thing good
simply and another good for a particular person), natural constitutions
and states of being, and therefore also the corresponding movements
and processes, will be correspondingly divisible. Of those which are
thought to be bad some will be bad if taken without qualification
but not bad for a particular person, but worthy of his choice, and
some will not be worthy of choice even for a particular person, but
only at a particular time and for a short period, though not without
qualification; while others are not even pleasures, but seem to be
so, viz. all those which involve pain and whose end is curative, e.g.
the processes that go on in sick persons. 

(b) Further, one kind of good being activity and another being state,
the processes that restore us to our natural state are only incidentally
pleasant; for that matter the activity at work in the appetites for
them is the activity of so much of our state and nature as has remained
unimpaired; for there are actually pleasures that involve no pain
or appetite (e.g. those of contemplation), the nature in such a case
not being defective at all. That the others are incidental is indicated
by the fact that men do not enjoy the same pleasant objects when their
nature is in its settled state as they do when it is being replenished,
but in the former case they enjoy the things that are pleasant without
qualification, in the latter the contraries of these as well; for
then they enjoy even sharp and bitter things, none of which is pleasant
either by nature or without qualification. The states they produce,
therefore, are not pleasures naturally or without qualification; for
as pleasant things differ, so do the pleasures arising from them.

(c) Again, it is not necessary that there should be something else
better than pleasure, as some say the end is better than the process;
for leasures are not processes nor do they all involve process-they
are activities and ends; nor do they arise when we are becoming something,
but when we are exercising some faculty; and not all pleasures have
an end different from themselves, but only the pleasures of persons
who are being led to the perfecting of their nature. This is why it
is not right to say that pleasure is perceptible process, but it should
rather be called activity of the natural state, and instead of 'perceptible'
'unimpeded'. It is thought by some people to be process just because
they think it is in the strict sense good; for they think that activity
is process, which it is not. 

(B) The view that pleasures are bad because some pleasant things are
unhealthy is like saying that healthy things are bad because some
healthy things are bad for money-making; both are bad in the respect
mentioned, but they are not bad for that reason-indeed, thinking itself
is sometimes injurious to health. 

Neither practical wisdom nor any state of being is impeded by the
pleasure arising from it; it is foreign pleasures that impede, for
the pleasures arising from thinking and learning will make us think
and learn all the more. 

(C) The fact that no pleasure is the product of any art arises naturally
enough; there is no art of any other activity either, but only of
the corresponding faculty; though for that matter the arts of the
perfumer and the cook are thought to be arts of pleasure.

(D) The arguments based on the grounds that the temperate man avoids
pleasure and that the man of practical wisdom pursues the painless
life, and that children and the brutes pursue pleasure, are all refuted
by the same consideration. We have pointed out in what sense pleasures
are good without qualification and in what sense some are not good;
now both the brutes and children pursue pleasures of the latter kind
(and the man of practical wisdom pursues tranquil freedom from that
kind), viz. those which imply appetite and pain, i.e. the bodily pleasures
(for it is these that are of this nature) and the excesses of them,
in respect of which the self-indulgent man is self-indulent. This
is why the temperate man avoids these pleasures; for even he has pleasures
of his own. 

13 

But further (E) it is agreed that pain is bad and to be avoided; for
some pain is without qualification bad, and other pain is bad because
it is in some respect an impediment to us. Now the contrary of that
which is to be avoided, qua something to be avoided and bad, is good.
Pleasure, then, is necessarily a good. For the answer of Speusippus,
that pleasure is contrary both to pain and to good, as the greater
is contrary both to the less and to the equal, is not successful;
since he would not say that pleasure is essentially just a species
of evil. 

And (F) if certain pleasures are bad, that does not prevent the chief
good from being some pleasure, just as the chief good may be some
form of knowledge though certain kinds of knowledge are bad. Perhaps
it is even necessary, if each disposition has unimpeded activities,
that, whether the activity (if unimpeded) of all our dispositions
or that of some one of them is happiness, this should be the thing
most worthy of our choice; and this activity is pleasure. Thus the
chief good would be some pleasure, though most pleasures might perhaps
be bad without qualification. And for this reason all men think that
the happy life is pleasant and weave pleasure into their ideal of
happiness-and reasonably too; for no activity is perfect when it is
impeded, and happiness is a perfect thing; this is why the happy man
needs the goods of the body and external goods, i.e. those of fortune,
viz. in order that he may not be impeded in these ways. Those who
say that the victim on the rack or the man who falls into great misfortunes
is happy if he is good, are, whether they mean to or not, talking
nonsense. Now because we need fortune as well as other things, some
people think good fortune the same thing as happiness; but it is not
that, for even good fortune itself when in excess is an impediment,
and perhaps should then be no longer called good fortune; for its
limit is fixed by reference to happiness. 

And indeed the fact that all things, both brutes and men, pursue pleasure
is an indication of its being somehow the chief good: 

No voice is wholly lost that many peoples... But since no one nature
or state either is or is thought the best for all, neither do all
pursue the same pleasure; yet all pursue pleasure. And perhaps they
actually pursue not the pleasure they think they pursue nor that which
they would say they pursue, but the same pleasure; for all things
have by nature something divine in them. But the bodily pleasures
have appropriated the name both because we oftenest steer our course
for them and because all men share in them; thus because they alone
are familiar, men think there are no others. 

It is evident also that if pleasure, i.e. the activity of our faculties,
is not a good, it will not be the case that the happy man lives a
pleasant life; for to what end should he need pleasure, if it is not
a good but the happy man may even live a painful life? For pain is
neither an evil nor a good, if pleasure is not; why then should he
avoid it? Therefore, too, the life of the good man will not be pleasanter
than that of any one else, if his activities are not more pleasant.

(G) With regard to the bodily pleasures, those who say that some pleasures
are very much to be chosen, viz. the noble pleasures, but not the
bodily pleasures, i.e. those with which the self-indulgent man is
concerned, must consider why, then, the contrary pains are bad. For
the contrary of bad is good. Are the necessary pleasures good in the
sense in which even that which is not bad is good? Or are they good
up to a point? Is it that where you have states and processes of which
there cannot be too much, there cannot be too much of the corresponding
pleasure, and that where there can be too much of the one there can
be too much of the other also? Now there can be too much of bodily
goods, and the bad man is bad by virtue of pursuing the excess, not
by virtue of pursuing the necessary pleasures (for all men enjoy in
some way or other both dainty foods and wines and sexual intercourse,
but not all men do so as they ought). The contrary is the case with
pain; for he does not avoid the excess of it, he avoids it altogether;
and this is peculiar to him, for the alternative to excess of pleasure
is not pain, except to the man who pursues this excess. 

Since we should state not only the truth, but also the cause of error-for
this contributes towards producing conviction, since when a reasonable
explanation is given of why the false view appears true, this tends
to produce belief in the true view-therefore we must state why the
bodily pleasures appear the more worthy of choice. (a) Firstly, then,
it is because they expel pain; owing to the excesses of pain that
men experience, they pursue excessive and in general bodily pleasure
as being a cure for the pain. Now curative agencies produce intense
feeling-which is the reason why they are pursued-because they show
up against the contrary pain. (Indeed pleasure is thought not to be
good for these two reasons, as has been said, viz. that (a) some of
them are activities belonging to a bad nature-either congenital, as
in the case of a brute, or due to habit, i.e. those of bad men; while
(b) others are meant to cure a defective nature, and it is better
to be in a healthy state than to be getting into it, but these arise
during the process of being made perfect and are therefore only incidentally
good., b) Further, they are pursued because of their violence by
those who cannot enjoy other pleasures. (At all events they go out
of their way to manufacture thirsts somehow for themselves. When these
are harmless, the practice is irreproachable; when they are hurtful,
it is bad.) For they have nothing else to enjoy, and, besides, a neutral
state is painful to many people because of their nature. For the animal
nature is always in travail, as the students of natural science also
testify, saying that sight and hearing are painful; but we have become
used to this, as they maintain. Similarly, while, in youth, people
are, owing to the growth that is going on, in a situation like that
of drunken men, and youth is pleasant, on the other hand people of
excitable nature always need relief; for even their body is ever in
torment owing to its special composition, and they are always under
the influence of violent desire; but pain is driven out both by the
contrary pleasure, and by any chance pleasure if it be strong; and
for these reasons they become self-indulgent and bad. But the pleasures
that do not involve pains do not admit of excess; and these are among
the things pleasant by nature and not incidentally. By things pleasant
incidentally I mean those that act as cures (for because as a result
people are cured, through some action of the part that remains healthy,
for this reason the process is thought pleasant); by things naturally
pleasant I mean those that stimulate the action of the healthy nature.

There is no one thing that is always pleasant, because our nature
is not simple but there is another element in us as well, inasmuch
as we are perishable creatures, so that if the one element does something,
this is unnatural to the other nature, and when the two elements are
evenly balanced, what is done seems neither painful nor pleasant;
for if the nature of anything were simple, the same action would always
be most pleasant to it. This is why God always enjoys a single and
simple pleasure; for there is not only an activity of movement but
an activity of immobility, and pleasure is found more in rest than
in movement. But 'change in all things is sweet', as the poet says,
because of some vice; for as it is the vicious man that is changeable,
so the nature that needs change is vicious; for it is not simple nor
good. 

We have now discussed continence and incontinence, and pleasure and
pain, both what each is and in what sense some of them are good and
others bad; it remains to speak of friendship.

BOOK VIII

1 

After what we have said, a discussion of friendship would naturally
follow, since it is a virtue or implies virtue, and is besides most
necessary with a view to living. For without friends no one would
choose to live, though he had all other goods; even rich men and those
in possession of office and of dominating power are thought to need
friends most of all; for what is the use of such prosperity without
the opportunity of beneficence, which is exercised chiefly and in
its most laudable form towards friends? Or how can prosperity be guarded
and preserved without friends? The greater it is, the more exposed
is it to risk. And in poverty and in other misfortunes men think friends
are the only refuge. It helps the young, too, to keep from error;
it aids older people by ministering to their needs and supplementing
the activities that are failing from weakness; those in the prime
of life it stimulates to noble actions-'two going together'-for with
friends men are more able both to think and to act. Again, parent
seems by nature to feel it for offspring and offspring for parent,
not only among men but among birds and among most animals; it is felt
mutually by members of the same race, and especially by men, whence
we praise lovers of their fellowmen. We may even in our travels how
near and dear every man is to every other. Friendship seems too to
hold states together, and lawgivers to care more for it than for justice;
for unanimity seems to be something like friendship, and this they
aim at most of all, and expel faction as their worst enemy; and when
men are friends they have no need of justice, while when they are
just they need friendship as well, and the truest form of justice
is thought to be a friendly quality. 

But it is not only necessary but also noble; for we praise those who
love their friends, and it is thought to be a fine thing to have many
friends; and again we think it is the same people that are good men
and are friends. 

Not a few things about friendship are matters of debate. Some define
it as a kind of likeness and say like people are friends, whence come
the sayings 'like to like', 'birds of a feather flock together', and
so on; others on the contrary say 'two of a trade never agree'. On
this very question they inquire for deeper and more physical causes,
Euripides saying that 'parched earth loves the rain, and stately heaven
when filled with rain loves to fall to earth', and Heraclitus that
'it is what opposes that helps' and 'from different tones comes the
fairest tune' and 'all things are produced through strife'; while
Empedocles, as well as others, expresses the opposite view that like
aims at like. The physical problems we may leave alone (for they do
not belong to the present inquiry); let us examine those which are
human and involve character and feeling, e.g. whether friendship can
arise between any two people or people cannot be friends if they are
wicked, and whether there is one species of friendship or more than
one. Those who think there is only one because it admits of degrees
have relied on an inadequate indication; for even things different
in species admit of degree. We have discussed this matter previously.

2 

The kinds of friendship may perhaps be cleared up if we first come
to know the object of love. For not everything seems to be loved but
only the lovable, and this is good, pleasant, or useful; but it would
seem to be that by which some good or pleasure is produced that is
useful, so that it is the good and the useful that are lovable as
ends. Do men love, then, the good, or what is good for them? These
sometimes clash. So too with regard to the pleasant. Now it is thought
that each loves what is good for himself, and that the good is without
qualification lovable, and what is good for each man is lovable for
him; but each man loves not what is good for him but what seems good.
This however will make no difference; we shall just have to say that
this is 'that which seems lovable'. Now there are three grounds on
which people love; of the love of lifeless objects we do not use the
word 'friendship'; for it is not mutual love, nor is there a wishing
of good to the other (for it would surely be ridiculous to wish wine
well; if one wishes anything for it, it is that it may keep, so that
one may have it oneself); but to a friend we say we ought to wish
what is good for his sake. But to those who thus wish good we ascribe
only goodwill, if the wish is not reciprocated; goodwill when it is
reciprocal being friendship. Or must we add 'when it is recognized'?
For many people have goodwill to those whom they have not seen but
judge to be good or useful; and one of these might return this feeling.
These people seem to bear goodwill to each other; but how could one
call them friends when they do not know their mutual feelings? To
be friends, then, the must be mutually recognized as bearing goodwill
and wishing well to each other for one of the aforesaid reasons.

3 

Now these reasons differ from each other in kind; so, therefore, do
the corresponding forms of love and friendship. There are therefore
three kinds of friendship, equal in number to the things that are
lovable; for with respect to each there is a mutual and recognized
love, and those who love each other wish well to each other in that
respect in which they love one another. Now those who love each other
for their utility do not love each other for themselves but in virtue
of some good which they get from each other. So too with those who
love for the sake of pleasure; it is not for their character that
men love ready-witted people, but because they find them pleasant.
Therefore those who love for the sake of utility love for the sake
of what is good for themselves, and those who love for the sake of
pleasure do so for the sake of what is pleasant to themselves, and
not in so far as the other is the person loved but in so far as he
is useful or pleasant. And thus these friendships are only incidental;
for it is not as being the man he is that the loved person is loved,
but as providing some good or pleasure. Such friendships, then, are
easily dissolved, if the parties do not remain like themselves; for
if the one party is no longer pleasant or useful the other ceases
to love him. 

Now the useful is not permanent but is always changing. Thus when
the motive of the friendship is done away, the friendship is dissolved,
inasmuch as it existed only for the ends in question. This kind of
friendship seems to exist chiefly between old people (for at that
age people pursue not the pleasant but the useful) and, of those who
are in their prime or young, between those who pursue utility. And
such people do not live much with each other either; for sometimes
they do not even find each other pleasant; therefore they do not need
such companionship unless they are useful to each other; for they
are pleasant to each other only in so far as they rouse in each other
hopes of something good to come. Among such friendships people also
class the friendship of a host and guest. On the other hand the friendship
of young people seems to aim at pleasure; for they live under the
guidance of emotion, and pursue above all what is pleasant to themselves
and what is immediately before them; but with increasing age their
pleasures become different. This is why they quickly become friends
and quickly cease to be so; their friendship changes with the object
that is found pleasant, and such pleasure alters quickly. Young people
are amorous too; for the greater part of the friendship of love depends
on emotion and aims at pleasure; this is why they fall in love and
quickly fall out of love, changing often within a single day. But
these people do wish to spend their days and lives together; for it
is thus that they attain the purpose of their friendship.

Perfect friendship is the friendship of men who are good, and alike
in virtue; for these wish well alike to each other qua good, and they
are good themselves. Now those who wish well to their friends for
their sake are most truly friends; for they do this by reason of own
nature and not incidentally; therefore their friendship lasts as long
as they are good-and goodness is an enduring thing. And each is good
without qualification and to his friend, for the good are both good
without qualification and useful to each other. So too they are pleasant;
for the good are pleasant both without qualification and to each other,
since to each his own activities and others like them are pleasurable,
and the actions of the good are the same or like. And such a friendship
is as might be expected permanent, since there meet in it all the
qualities that friends should have. For all friendship is for the
sake of good or of pleasure-good or pleasure either in the abstract
or such as will be enjoyed by him who has the friendly feeling-and
is based on a certain resemblance; and to a friendship of good men
all the qualities we have named belong in virtue of the nature of
the friends themselves; for in the case of this kind of friendship
the other qualities also are alike in both friends, and that which
is good without qualification is also without qualification pleasant,
and these are the most lovable qualities. Love and friendship therefore
are found most and in their best form between such men. 

But it is natural that such friendships should be infrequent; for
such men are rare. Further, such friendship requires time and familiarity;
as the proverb says, men cannot know each other till they have 'eaten
salt together'; nor can they admit each other to friendship or be
friends till each has been found lovable and been trusted by each.
Those who quickly show the marks of friendship to each other wish
to be friends, but are not friends unless they both are lovable and
know the fact; for a wish for friendship may arise quickly, but friendship
does not. 

4 

This kind of friendship, then, is perfect both in respect of duration
and in all other respects, and in it each gets from each in all respects
the same as, or something like what, he gives; which is what ought
to happen between friends. Friendship for the sake of pleasure bears
a resemblance to this kind; for good people too are pleasant to each
other. So too does friendship for the sake of utility; for the good
are also useful to each other. Among men of these inferior sorts too,
friendships are most permanent when the friends get the same thing
from each other (e.g. pleasure), and not only that but also from the
same source, as happens between readywitted people, not as happens
between lover and beloved. For these do not take pleasure in the same
things, but the one in seeing the beloved and the other in receiving
attentions from his lover; and when the bloom of youth is passing
the friendship sometimes passes too (for the one finds no pleasure
in the sight of the other, and the other gets no attentions from the
first); but many lovers on the other hand are constant, if familiarity
has led them to love each other's characters, these being alike. But
those who exchange not pleasure but utility in their amour are both
less truly friends and less constant. Those who are friends for the
sake of utility part when the advantage is at an end; for they were
lovers not of each other but of profit. 

For the sake of pleasure or utility, then, even bad men may be friends
of each other, or good men of bad, or one who is neither good nor
bad may be a friend to any sort of person, but for their own sake
clearly only good men can be friends; for bad men do not delight in
each other unless some advantage come of the relation. 

The friendship of the good too and this alone is proof against slander;
for it is not easy to trust any one talk about a man who has long
been tested by oneself; and it is among good men that trust and the
feeling that 'he would never wrong me' and all the other things that
are demanded in true friendship are found. In the other kinds of friendship,
however, there is nothing to prevent these evils arising. For men
apply the name of friends even to those whose motive is utility, in
which sense states are said to be friendly (for the alliances of states
seem to aim at advantage), and to those who love each other for the
sake of pleasure, in which sense children are called friends. Therefore
we too ought perhaps to call such people friends, and say that there
are several kinds of friendship-firstly and in the proper sense that
of good men qua good, and by analogy the other kinds; for it is in
virtue of something good and something akin to what is found in true
friendship that they are friends, since even the pleasant is good
for the lovers of pleasure. But these two kinds of friendship are
not often united, nor do the same people become friends for the sake
of utility and of pleasure; for things that are only incidentally
connected are not often coupled together. 

Friendship being divided into these kinds, bad men will be friends
for the sake of pleasure or of utility, being in this respect like
each other, but good men will be friends for their own sake, i.e.
in virtue of their goodness. These, then, are friends without qualification;
the others are friends incidentally and through a resemblance to these.

5 

As in regard to the virtues some men are called good in respect of
a state of character, others in respect of an activity, so too in
the case of friendship; for those who live together delight in each
other and confer benefits on each other, but those who are asleep
or locally separated are not performing, but are disposed to perform,
the activities of friendship; distance does not break off the friendship
absolutely, but only the activity of it. But if the absence is lasting,
it seems actually to make men forget their friendship; hence the saying
'out of sight, out of mind'. Neither old people nor sour people seem
to make friends easily; for there is little that is pleasant in them,
and no one can spend his days with one whose company is painful, or
not pleasant, since nature seems above all to avoid the painful and
to aim at the pleasant. Those, however, who approve of each other
but do not live together seem to be well-disposed rather than actual
friends. For there is nothing so characteristic of friends as living
together (since while it people who are in need that desire benefits,
even those who are supremely happy desire to spend their days together;
for solitude suits such people least of all); but people cannot live
together if they are not pleasant and do not enjoy the same things,
as friends who are companions seem to do. 

The truest friendship, then, is that of the good, as we have frequently
said; for that which is without qualification good or pleasant seems
to be lovable and desirable, and for each person that which is good
or pleasant to him; and the good man is lovable and desirable to the
good man for both these reasons. Now it looks as if love were a feeling,
friendship a state of character; for love may be felt just as much
towards lifeless things, but mutual love involves choice and choice
springs from a state of character; and men wish well to those whom
they love, for their sake, not as a result of feeling but as a result
of a state of character. And in loving a friend men love what is good
for themselves; for the good man in becoming a friend becomes a good
to his friend. Each, then, both loves what is good for himself, and
makes an equal return in goodwill and in pleasantness; for friendship
is said to be equality, and both of these are found most in the friendship
of the good. 

6 

Between sour and elderly people friendship arises less readily, inasmuch
as they are less good-tempered and enjoy companionship less; for these
are thou to be the greatest marks of friendship productive of it.
This is why, while men become friends quickly, old men do not; it
is because men do not become friends with those in whom they do not
delight; and similarly sour people do not quickly make friends either.
But such men may bear goodwill to each other; for they wish one another
well and aid one another in need; but they are hardly friends because
they do not spend their days together nor delight in each other, and
these are thought the greatest marks of friendship. 

One cannot be a friend to many people in the sense of having friendship
of the perfect type with them, just as one cannot be in love with
many people at once (for love is a sort of excess of feeling, and
it is the nature of such only to be felt towards one person); and
it is not easy for many people at the same time to please the same
person very greatly, or perhaps even to be good in his eyes. One must,
too, acquire some experience of the other person and become familiar
with him, and that is very hard. But with a view to utility or pleasure
it is possible that many people should please one; for many people
are useful or pleasant, and these services take little time.

Of these two kinds that which is for the sake of pleasure is the more
like friendship, when both parties get the same things from each other
and delight in each other or in the things, as in the friendships
of the young; for generosity is more found in such friendships. Friendship
based on utility is for the commercially minded. People who are supremely
happy, too, have no need of useful friends, but do need pleasant friends;
for they wish to live with some one and, though they can endure for
a short time what is painful, no one could put up with it continuously,
nor even with the Good itself if it were painful to him; this is why
they look out for friends who are pleasant. Perhaps they should look
out for friends who, being pleasant, are also good, and good for them
too; for so they will have all the characteristics that friends should
have. 

People in positions of authority seem to have friends who fall into
distinct classes; some people are useful to them and others are pleasant,
but the same people are rarely both; for they seek neither those whose
pleasantness is accompanied by virtue nor those whose utility is with
a view to noble objects, but in their desire for pleasure they seek
for ready-witted people, and their other friends they choose as being
clever at doing what they are told, and these characteristics are
rarely combined. Now we have said that the good man is at the same
time pleasant and useful; but such a man does not become the friend
of one who surpasses him in station, unless he is surpassed also in
virtue; if this is not so, he does not establish equality by being
proportionally exceeded in both respects. But people who surpass him
in both respects are not so easy to find. 

However that may be, the aforesaid friendships involve equality; for
the friends get the same things from one another and wish the same
things for one another, or exchange one thing for another, e.g. pleasure
for utility; we have said, however, that they are both less truly
friendships and less permanent. 

But it is from their likeness and their unlikeness to the same thing
that they are thought both to be and not to be friendships. It is
by their likeness to the friendship of virtue that they seem to be
friendships (for one of them involves pleasure and the other utility,
and these characteristics belong to the friendship of virtue as well);
while it is because the friendship of virtue is proof against slander
and permanent, while these quickly change (besides differing from
the former in many other respects), that they appear not to be friendships;
i.e. it is because of their unlikeness to the friendship of virtue.

7 

But there is another kind of friendship, viz. that which involves
an inequality between the parties, e.g. that of father to son and
in general of elder to younger, that of man to wife and in general
that of ruler to subject. And these friendships differ also from each
other; for it is not the same that exists between parents and children
and between rulers and subjects, nor is even that of father to son
the same as that of son to father, nor that of husband to wife the
same as that of wife to husband. For the virtue and the function of
each of these is different, and so are the reasons for which they
love; the love and the friendship are therefore different also. Each
party, then, neither gets the same from the other, nor ought to seek
it; but when children render to parents what they ought to render
to those who brought them into the world, and parents render what
they should to their children, the friendship of such persons will
be abiding and excellent. In all friendships implying inequality the
love also should be proportional, i.e. the better should be more loved
than he loves, and so should the more useful, and similarly in each
of the other cases; for when the love is in proportion to the merit
of the parties, then in a sense arises equality, which is certainly
held to be characteristic of friendship. 

But equality does not seem to take the same form in acts of justice
and in friendship; for in acts of justice what is equal in the primary
sense is that which is in proportion to merit, while quantitative
equality is secondary, but in friendship quantitative equality is
primary and proportion to merit secondary. This becomes clear if there
is a great interval in respect of virtue or vice or wealth or anything
else between the parties; for then they are no longer friends, and
do not even expect to be so. And this is most manifest in the case
of the gods; for they surpass us most decisively in all good things.
But it is clear also in the case of kings; for with them, too, men
who are much their inferiors do not expect to be friends; nor do men
of no account expect to be friends with the best or wisest men. In
such cases it is not possible to define exactly up to what point friends
can remain friends; for much can be taken away and friendship remain,
but when one party is removed to a great distance, as God is, the
possibility of friendship ceases. This is in fact the origin of the
question whether friends really wish for their friends the greatest
goods, e.g. that of being gods; since in that case their friends will
no longer be friends to them, and therefore will not be good things
for them (for friends are good things). The answer is that if we were
right in saying that friend wishes good to friend for his sake, his
friend must remain the sort of being he is, whatever that may be;
therefore it is for him oily so long as he remains a man that he will
wish the greatest goods. But perhaps not all the greatest goods; for
it is for himself most of all that each man wishes what is good.

8 

Most people seem, owing to ambition, to wish to be loved rather than
to love; which is why most men love flattery; for the flatterer is
a friend in an inferior position, or pretends to be such and to love
more than he is loved; and being loved seems to be akin to being honoured,
and this is what most people aim at. But it seems to be not for its
own sake that people choose honour, but incidentally. For most people
enjoy being honoured by those in positions of authority because of
their hopes (for they think that if they want anything they will get
it from them; and therefore they delight in honour as a token of favour
to come); while those who desire honour from good men, and men who
know, are aiming at confirming their own opinion of themselves; they
delight in honour, therefore, because they believe in their own goodness
on the strength of the judgement of those who speak about them. In
being loved, on the other hand, people delight for its own sake; whence
it would seem to be better than being honoured, and friendship to
be desirable in itself. But it seems to lie in loving rather than
in being loved, as is indicated by the delight mothers take in loving;
for some mothers hand over their children to be brought up, and so
long as they know their fate they love them and do not seek to be
loved in return (if they cannot have both), but seem to be satisfied
if they see them prospering; and they themselves love their children
even if these owing to their ignorance give them nothing of a mother's
due. Now since friendship depends more on loving, and it is those
who love their friends that are praised, loving seems to be the characteristic
virtue of friends, so that it is only those in whom this is found
in due measure that are lasting friends, and only their friendship
that endures. 

It is in this way more than any other that even unequals can be friends;
they can be equalized. Now equality and likeness are friendship, and
especially the likeness of those who are like in virtue; for being
steadfast in themselves they hold fast to each other, and neither
ask nor give base services, but (one may say) even prevent them; for
it is characteristic of good men neither to go wrong themselves nor
to let their friends do so. But wicked men have no steadfastness (for
they do not remain even like to themselves), but become friends for
a short time because they delight in each other's wickedness. Friends
who are useful or pleasant last longer; i.e. as long as they provide
each other with enjoyments or advantages. Friendship for utility's
sake seems to be that which most easily exists between contraries,
e.g. between poor and rich, between ignorant and learned; for what
a man actually lacks he aims at, and one gives something else in return.
But under this head, too, might bring lover and beloved, beautiful
and ugly. This is why lovers sometimes seem ridiculous, when they
demand to be loved as they love; if they are equally lovable their
claim can perhaps be justified, but when they have nothing lovable
about them it is ridiculous. Perhaps, however, contrary does not even
aim at contrary by its own nature, but only incidentally, the desire
being for what is intermediate; for that is what is good, e.g. it
is good for the dry not to become wet but to come to the intermediate
state, and similarly with the hot and in all other cases. These subjects
we may dismiss; for they are indeed somewhat foreign to our inquiry.

9 

Friendship and justice seem, as we have said at the outset of our
discussion, to be concerned with the same objects and exhibited between
the same persons. For in every community there is thought to be some
form of justice, and friendship too; at least men address as friends
their fellow-voyagers and fellowsoldiers, and so too those associated
with them in any other kind of community. And the extent of their
association is the extent of their friendship, as it is the extent
to which justice exists between them. And the proverb 'what friends
have is common property' expresses the truth; for friendship depends
on community. Now brothers and comrades have all things in common,
but the others to whom we have referred have definite things in common-some
more things, others fewer; for of friendships, too, some are more
and others less truly friendships. And the claims of justice differ
too; the duties of parents to children, and those of brothers to each
other are not the same, nor those of comrades and those of fellow-citizens,
and so, too, with the other kinds of friendship. There is a difference,
therefore, also between the acts that are unjust towards each of these
classes of associates, and the injustice increases by being exhibited
towards those who are friends in a fuller sense; e.g. it is a more
terrible thing to defraud a comrade than a fellow-citizen, more terrible
not to help a brother than a stranger, and more terrible to wound
a father than any one else. And the demands of justice also seem to
increase with the intensity of the friendship, which implies that
friendship and justice exist between the same persons and have an
equal extension. 

Now all forms of community are like parts of the political community;
for men journey together with a view to some particular advantage,
and to provide something that they need for the purposes of life;
and it is for the sake of advantage that the political community too
seems both to have come together originally and to endure, for this
is what legislators aim at, and they call just that which is to the
common advantage. Now the other communities aim at advantage bit by
bit, e.g. sailors at what is advantageous on a voyage with a view
to making money or something of the kind, fellow-soldiers at what
is advantageous in war, whether it is wealth or victory or the taking
of a city that they seek, and members of tribes and demes act similarly
(Some communities seem to arise for the sake or pleasure, viz. religious
guilds and social clubs; for these exist respectively for the sake
of offering sacrifice and of companionship. But all these seem to
fall under the political community; for it aims not at present advantage
but at what is advantageous for life as a whole), offering sacrifices
and arranging gatherings for the purpose, and assigning honours to
the gods, and providing pleasant relaxations for themselves. For the
ancient sacrifices and gatherings seem to take place after the harvest
as a sort of firstfruits, because it was at these seasons that people
had most leisure. All the communities, then, seem to be parts of the
political community; and the particular kinds friendship will correspond
to the particular kinds of community.

There are three kinds of constitution, and an equal number of deviation-forms--perversions,
as it were, of them. The constitutions are monarchy, aristocracy,
and thirdly that which is based on a property qualification, which
it seems appropriate to call timocratic, though most people are wont
to call it polity. The best of these is monarchy, the worst timocracy.
The deviation from monarchy is tyrany; for both are forms of one-man
rule, but there is the greatest difference between them; the tyrant
looks to his own advantage, the king to that of his subjects. For
a man is not a king unless he is sufficient to himself and excels
his subjects in all good things; and such a man needs nothing further;
therefore he will not look to his own interests but to those of his
subjects; for a king who is not like that would be a mere titular
king. Now tyranny is the very contrary of this; the tyrant pursues
his own good. And it is clearer in the case of tyranny that it is
the worst deviation-form; but it is the contrary of the best that
is worst. Monarchy passes over into tyranny; for tyranny is the evil
form of one-man rule and the bad king becomes a tyrant. Aristocracy
passes over into oligarchy by the badness of the rulers, who distribute
contrary to equity what belongs to the city-all or most of the good
things to themselves, and office always to the same people, paying
most regard to wealth; thus the rulers are few and are bad men instead
of the most worthy. Timocracy passes over into democracy; for these
are coterminous, since it is the ideal even of timocracy to be the
rule of the majority, and all who have the property qualification
count as equal. Democracy is the least bad of the deviations; for
in its case the form of constitution is but a slight deviation. These
then are the changes to which constitutions are most subject; for
these are the smallest and easiest transitions. 

One may find resemblances to the constitutions and, as it were, patterns
of them even in households. For the association of a father with his
sons bears the form of monarchy, since the father cares for his children;
and this is why Homer calls Zeus 'father'; it is the ideal of monarchy
to be paternal rule. But among the Persians the rule of the father
is tyrannical; they use their sons as slaves. Tyrannical too is the
rule of a master over slaves; for it is the advantage of the master
that is brought about in it. Now this seems to be a correct form of
government, but the Persian type is perverted; for the modes of rule
appropriate to different relations are diverse. The association of
man and wife seems to be aristocratic; for the man rules in accordance
with his worth, and in those matters in which a man should rule, but
the matters that befit a woman he hands over to her. If the man rules
in everything the relation passes over into oligarchy; for in doing
so he is not acting in accordance with their respective worth, and
not ruling in virtue of his superiority. Sometimes, however, women
rule, because they are heiresses; so their rule is not in virtue of
excellence but due to wealth and power, as in oligarchies. The association
of brothers is like timocracy; for they are equal, except in so far
as they differ in age; hence if they differ much in age, the friendship
is no longer of the fraternal type. Democracy is found chiefly in
masterless dwellings (for here every one is on an equality), and in
those in which the ruler is weak and every one has licence to do as
he pleases. 

11 

Each of the constitutions may be seen to involve friendship just in
so far as it involves justice. The friendship between a king and his
subjects depends on an excess of benefits conferred; for he confers
benefits on his subjects if being a good man he cares for them with
a view to their well-being, as a shepherd does for his sheep (whence
Homer called Agamemnon 'shepherd of the peoples'). Such too is the
friendship of a father, though this exceeds the other in the greatness
of the benefits conferred; for he is responsible for the existence
of his children, which is thought the greatest good, and for their
nurture and upbringing. 

These things are ascribed to ancestors as well. Further, by nature
a father tends to rule over his sons, ancestors over descendants,
a king over his subjects. These friendships imply superiority of one
party over the other, which is why ancestors are honoured. The justice
therefore that exists between persons so related is not the same on
both sides but is in every case proportioned to merit; for that is
true of the friendship as well. The friendship of man and wife, again,
is the same that is found in an aristocracy; for it is in accordance
with virtue the better gets more of what is good, and each gets what
befits him; and so, too, with the justice in these relations. The
friendship of brothers is like that of comrades; for they are equal
and of like age, and such persons are for the most part like in their
feelings and their character. Like this, too, is the friendship appropriate
to timocratic government; for in such a constitution the ideal is
for the citizens to be equal and fair; therefore rule is taken in
turn, and on equal terms; and the friendship appropriate here will
correspond. 

But in the deviation-forms, as justice hardly exists, so too does
friendship. It exists least in the worst form; in tyranny there is
little or no friendship. For where there is nothing common to ruler
and ruled, there is not friendship either, since there is not justice;
e.g. between craftsman and tool, soul and body, master and slave;
the latter in each case is benefited by that which uses it, but there
is no friendship nor justice towards lifeless things. But neither
is there friendship towards a horse or an ox, nor to a slave qua slave.
For there is nothing common to the two parties; the slave is a living
tool and the tool a lifeless slave. Qua slave then, one cannot be
friends with him. But qua man one can; for there seems to be some
justice between any man and any other who can share in a system of
law or be a party to an agreement; therefore there can also be friendship
with him in so far as he is a man. Therefore while in tyrannies friendship
and justice hardly exist, in democracies they exist more fully; for
where the citizens are equal they have much in common. 

12 

Every form of friendship, then, involves association, as has been
said. One might, however, mark off from the rest both the friendship
of kindred and that of comrades. Those of fellow-citizens, fellow-tribesmen,
fellow-voyagers, and the like are more like mere friendships of association;
for they seem to rest on a sort of compact. With them we might class
the friendship of host and guest. The friendship of kinsmen itself,
while it seems to be of many kinds, appears to depend in every case
on parental friendship; for parents love their children as being a
part of themselves, and children their parents as being something
originating from them. Now (1) arents know their offspring better
than there children know that they are their children, and (2) the
originator feels his offspring to be his own more than the offspring
do their begetter; for the product belongs to the producer (e.g. a
tooth or hair or anything else to him whose it is), but the producer
does not belong to the product, or belongs in a less degree. And (3)
the length of time produces the same result; parents love their children
as soon as these are born, but children love their parents only after
time has elapsed and they have acquired understanding or the power
of discrimination by the senses. From these considerations it is also
plain why mothers love more than fathers do. Parents, then, love their
children as themselves (for their issue are by virtue of their separate
existence a sort of other selves), while children love their parents
as being born of them, and brothers love each other as being born
of the same parents; for their identity with them makes them identical
with each other (which is the reason why people talk of 'the same
blood', 'the same stock', and so on). They are, therefore, in a sense
the same thing, though in separate individuals. Two things that contribute
greatly to friendship are a common upbringing and similarity of age;
for 'two of an age take to each other', and people brought up together
tend to be comrades; whence the friendship of brothers is akin to
that of comrades. And cousins and other kinsmen are bound up together
by derivation from brothers, viz. by being derived from the same parents.
They come to be closer together or farther apart by virtue of the
nearness or distance of the original ancestor. 

The friendship of children to parents, and of men to gods, is a relation
to them as to something good and superior; for they have conferred
the greatest benefits, since they are the causes of their being and
of their nourishment, and of their education from their birth; and
this kind of friendship possesses pleasantness and utility also, more
than that of strangers, inasmuch as their life is lived more in common.
The friendship of brothers has the characteristics found in that of
comrades (and especially when these are good), and in general between
people who are like each other, inasmuch as they belong more to each
other and start with a love for each other from their very birth,
and inasmuch as those born of the same parents and brought up together
and similarly educated are more akin in character; and the test of
time has been applied most fully and convincingly in their case.

Between other kinsmen friendly relations are found in due proportion.
Between man and wife friendship seems to exist by nature; for man
is naturally inclined to form couples-even more than to form cities,
inasmuch as the household is earlier and more necessary than the city,
and reproduction is more common to man with the animals. With the
other animals the union extends only to this point, but human beings
live together not only for the sake of reproduction but also for the
various purposes of life; for from the start the functions are divided,
and those of man and woman are different; so they help each other
by throwing their peculiar gifts into the common stock. It is for
these reasons that both utility and pleasure seem to be found in this
kind of friendship. But this friendship may be based also on virtue,
if the parties are good; for each has its own virtue and they will
delight in the fact. And children seem to be a bond of union (which
is the reason why childless people part more easily); for children
are a good common to both and what is common holds them together.

How man and wife and in general friend and friend ought mutually to
behave seems to be the same question as how it is just for them to
behave; for a man does not seem to have the same duties to a friend,
a stranger, a comrade, and a schoolfellow. 

13 

There are three kinds of friendship, as we said at the outset of our
inquiry, and in respect of each some are friends on an equality and
others by virtue of a superiority (for not only can equally good men
become friends but a better man can make friends with a worse, and
similarly in friendships of pleasure or utility the friends may be
equal or unequal in the benefits they confer). This being so, equals
must effect the required equalization on a basis of equality in love
and in all other respects, while unequals must render what is in proportion
to their superiority or inferiority. Complaints and reproaches arise
either only or chiefly in the friendship of utility, and this is only
to be expected. For those who are friends on the ground of virtue
are anxious to do well by each other (since that is a mark of virtue
and of friendship), and between men who are emulating each other in
this there cannot be complaints or quarrels; no one is offended by
a man who loves him and does well by him-if he is a person of nice
feeling he takes his revenge by doing well by the other. And the man
who excels the other in the services he renders will not complain
of his friend, since he gets what he aims at; for each man desires
what is good. Nor do complaints arise much even in friendships of
pleasure; for both get at the same time what they desire, if they
enjoy spending their time together; and even a man who complained
of another for not affording him pleasure would seem ridiculous, since
it is in his power not to spend his days with him. 

But the friendship of utility is full of complaints; for as they use
each other for their own interests they always want to get the better
of the bargain, and think they have got less than they should, and
blame their partners because they do not get all they 'want and deserve';
and those who do well by others cannot help them as much as those
whom they benefit want. 

Now it seems that, as justice is of two kinds, one unwritten and the
other legal, one kind of friendship of utility is moral and the other
legal. And so complaints arise most of all when men do not dissolve
the relation in the spirit of the same type of friendship in which
they contracted it. The legal type is that which is on fixed terms;
its purely commercial variety is on the basis of immediate payment,
while the more liberal variety allows time but stipulates for a definite
quid pro quo. In this variety the debt is clear and not ambiguous,
but in the postponement it contains an element of friendliness; and
so some states do not allow suits arising out of such agreements,
but think men who have bargained on a basis of credit ought to accept
the consequences. The moral type is not on fixed terms; it makes a
gift, or does whatever it does, as to a friend; but one expects to
receive as much or more, as having not given but lent; and if a man
is worse off when the relation is dissolved than he was when it was
contracted he will complain. This happens because all or most men,
while they wish for what is noble, choose what is advantageous; now
it is noble to do well by another without a view to repayment, but
it is the receiving of benefits that is advantageous. Therefore if
we can we should return the equivalent of what we have received (for
we must not make a man our friend against his will; we must recognize
that we were mistaken at the first and took a benefit from a person
we should not have taken it from-since it was not from a friend, nor
from one who did it just for the sake of acting so-and we must settle
up just as if we had been benefited on fixed terms). Indeed, one would
agree to repay if one could (if one could not, even the giver would
not have expected one to do so); therefore if it is possible we must
repay. But at the outset we must consider the man by whom we are being
benefited and on what terms he is acting, in order that we may accept
the benefit on these terms, or else decline it. 

It is disputable whether we ought to measure a service by its utility
to the receiver and make the return with a view to that, or by the
benevolence of the giver. For those who have received say they have
received from their benefactors what meant little to the latter and
what they might have got from others-minimizing the service; while
the givers, on the contrary, say it was the biggest thing they had,
and what could not have been got from others, and that it was given
in times of danger or similar need. Now if the friendship is one that
aims at utility, surely the advantage to the receiver is the measure.
For it is he that asks for the service, and the other man helps him
on the assumption that he will receive the equivalent; so the assistance
has been precisely as great as the advantage to the receiver, and
therefore he must return as much as he has received, or even more
(for that would be nobler). In friendships based on virtue on the
other hand, complaints do not arise, but the purpose of the doer is
a sort of measure; for in purpose lies the essential element of virtue
and character. 

14 

Differences arise also in friendships based on superiority; for each
expects to get more out of them, but when this happens the friendship
is dissolved. Not only does the better man think he ought to get more,
since more should be assigned to a good man, but the more useful similarly
expects this; they say a useless man should not get as much as they
should, since it becomes an act of public service and not a friendship
if the proceeds of the friendship do not answer to the worth of the
benefits conferred. For they think that, as in a commercial partnership
those who put more in get more out, so it should be in friendship.
But the man who is in a state of need and inferiority makes the opposite
claim; they think it is the part of a good friend to help those who
are in need; what, they say, is the use of being the friend of a good
man or a powerful man, if one is to get nothing out of it?

At all events it seems that each party is justified in his claim,
and that each should get more out of the friendship than the other-not
more of the same thing, however, but the superior more honour and
the inferior more gain; for honour is the prize of virtue and of beneficence,
while gain is the assistance required by inferiority. 

It seems to be so in constitutional arrangements also; the man who
contributes nothing good to the common stock is not honoured; for
what belongs to the public is given to the man who benefits the public,
and honour does belong to the public. It is not possible to get wealth
from the common stock and at the same time honour. For no one puts
up with the smaller share in all things; therefore to the man who
loses in wealth they assign honour and to the man who is willing to
be paid, wealth, since the proportion to merit equalizes the parties
and preserves the friendship, as we have said. This then is also the
way in which we should associate with unequals; the man who is benefited
in respect of wealth or virtue must give honour in return, repaying
what he can. For friendship asks a man to do what he can, not what
is proportional to the merits of the case; since that cannot always
be done, e.g. in honours paid to the gods or to parents; for no one
could ever return to them the equivalent of what he gets, but the
man who serves them to the utmost of his power is thought to be a
good man. This is why it would not seem open to a man to disown his
father (though a father may disown his son); being in debt, he should
repay, but there is nothing by doing which a son will have done the
equivalent of what he has received, so that he is always in debt.
But creditors can remit a debt; and a father can therefore do so too.
At the same time it is thought that presumably no one would repudiate
a son who was not far gone in wickedness; for apart from the natural
friendship of father and son it is human nature not to reject a son's
assistance. But the son, if he is wicked, will naturally avoid aiding
his father, or not be zealous about it; for most people wish to get
benefits, but avoid doing them, as a thing unprofitable.-So much for
these questions. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK IX

1 

In all friendships between dissimilars it is, as we have said, proportion
that equalizes the parties and preserves the friendship; e.g. in the
political form of friendship the shoemaker gets a return for his shoes
in proportion to his worth, and the weaver and all other craftsmen
do the same. Now here a common measure has been provided in the form
of money, and therefore everything is referred to this and measured
by this; but in the friendship of lovers sometimes the lover complains
that his excess of love is not met by love in return though perhaps
there is nothing lovable about him), while often the beloved complains
that the lover who formerly promised everything now performs nothing.
Such incidents happen when the lover loves the beloved for the sake
of pleasure while the beloved loves the lover for the sake of utility,
and they do not both possess the qualities expected of them. If these
be the objects of the friendship it is dissolved when they do not
get the things that formed the motives of their love; for each did
not love the other person himself but the qualities he had, and these
were not enduring; that is why the friendships also are transient.
But the love of characters, as has been said, endures because it is
self-dependent. Differences arise when what they get is something
different and not what they desire; for it is like getting nothing
at all when we do not get what we aim at; compare the story of the
person who made promises to a lyre-player, promising him the more,
the better he sang, but in the morning, when the other demanded the
fulfilment of his promises, said that he had given pleasure for pleasure.
Now if this had been what each wanted, all would have been well; but
if the one wanted enjoyment but the other gain, and the one has what
he wants while the other has not, the terms of the association will
not have been properly fulfilled; for what each in fact wants is what
he attends to, and it is for the sake of that that that he will give
what he has. 

But who is to fix the worth of the service; he who makes the sacrifice
or he who has got the advantage? At any rate the other seems to leave
it to him. This is what they say Protagoras used to do; whenever he
taught anything whatsoever, he bade the learner assess the value of
the knowledge, and accepted the amount so fixed. But in such matters
some men approve of the saying 'let a man have his fixed reward'.
Those who get the money first and then do none of the things they
said they would, owing to the extravagance of their promises, naturally
find themselves the objects of complaint; for they do not fulfil what
they agreed to. The sophists are perhaps compelled to do this because
no one would give money for the things they do know. These people
then, if they do not do what they have been paid for, are naturally
made the objects of complaint. 

But where there is no contract of service, those who give up something
for the sake of the other party cannot (as we have said) be complained
of (for that is the nature of the friendship of virtue), and the return
to them must be made on the basis of their purpose (for it is purpose
that is the characteristic thing in a friend and in virtue). And so
too, it seems, should one make a return to those with whom one has
studied philosophy; for their worth cannot be measured against money,
and they can get no honour which will balance their services, but
still it is perhaps enough, as it is with the gods and with one's
parents, to give them what one can. 

If the gift was not of this sort, but was made with a view to a return,
it is no doubt preferable that the return made should be one that
seems fair to both parties, but if this cannot be achieved, it would
seem not only necessary that the person who gets the first service
should fix the reward, but also just; for if the other gets in return
the equivalent of the advantage the beneficiary has received, or the
price lie would have paid for the pleasure, he will have got what
is fair as from the other. 

We see this happening too with things put up for sale, and in some
places there are laws providing that no actions shall arise out of
voluntary contracts, on the assumption that one should settle with
a person to whom one has given credit, in the spirit in which one
bargained with him. The law holds that it is more just that the person
to whom credit was given should fix the terms than that the person
who gave credit should do so. For most things are not assessed at
the same value by those who have them and those who want them; each
class values highly what is its own and what it is offering; yet the
return is made on the terms fixed by the receiver. But no doubt the
receiver should assess a thing not at what it seems worth when he
has it, but at what he assessed it at before he had it. 

2 

A further problem is set by such questions as, whether one should
in all things give the preference to one's father and obey him, or
whether when one is ill one should trust a doctor, and when one has
to elect a general should elect a man of military skill; and similarly
whether one should render a service by preference to a friend or to
a good man, and should show gratitude to a benefactor or oblige a
friend, if one cannot do both. 

All such questions are hard, are they not, to decide with precision?
For they admit of many variations of all sorts in respect both of
the magnitude of the service and of its nobility necessity. But that
we should not give the preference in all things to the same person
is plain enough; and we must for the most part return benefits rather
than oblige friends, as we must pay back a loan to a creditor rather
than make one to a friend. But perhaps even this is not always true;
e.g. should a man who has been ransomed out of the hands of brigands
ransom his ransomer in return, whoever he may be (or pay him if he
has not been captured but demands payment) or should he ransom his
father? It would seem that he should ransom his father in preference
even to himself. As we have said, then, generally the debt should
be paid, but if the gift is exceedingly noble or exceedingly necessary,
one should defer to these considerations. For sometimes it is not
even fair to return the equivalent of what one has received, when
the one man has done a service to one whom he knows to be good, while
the other makes a return to one whom he believes to be bad. For that
matter, one should sometimes not lend in return to one who has lent
to oneself; for the one person lent to a good man, expecting to recover
his loan, while the other has no hope of recovering from one who is
believed to be bad. Therefore if the facts really are so, the demand
is not fair; and if they are not, but people think they are, they
would be held to be doing nothing strange in refusing. As we have
often pointed out, then, discussions about feelings and actions have
just as much definiteness as their subject-matter. 

That we should not make the same return to every one, nor give a father
the preference in everything, as one does not sacrifice everything
to Zeus, is plain enough; but since we ought to render different things
to parents, brothers, comrades, and benefactors, we ought to render
to each class what is appropriate and becoming. And this is what people
seem in fact to do; to marriages they invite their kinsfolk; for these
have a part in the family and therefore in the doings that affect
the family; and at funerals also they think that kinsfolk, before
all others, should meet, for the same reason. And it would be thought
that in the matter of food we should help our parents before all others,
since we owe our own nourishment to them, and it is more honourable
to help in this respect the authors of our being even before ourselves;
and honour too one should give to one's parents as one does to the
gods, but not any and every honour; for that matter one should not
give the same honour to one's father and one's mother, nor again should
one give them the honour due to a philosopher or to a general, but
the honour due to a father, or again to a mother. To all older persons,
too, one should give honour appropriate to their age, by rising to
receive them and finding seats for them and so on; while to comrades
and brothers one should allow freedom of speech and common use of
all things. To kinsmen, too, and fellow-tribesmen and fellow-citizens
and to every other class one should always try to assign what is appropriate,
and to compare the claims of each class with respect to nearness of
relation and to virtue or usefulness. The comparison is easier when
the persons belong to the same class, and more laborious when they
are different. Yet we must not on that account shrink from the task,
but decide the question as best we can. 

3 

Another question that arises is whether friendships should or should
not be broken off when the other party does not remain the same. Perhaps
we may say that there is nothing strange in breaking off a friendship
based on utility or pleasure, when our friends no longer have these
attributes. For it was of these attributes that we were the friends;
and when these have failed it is reasonable to love no longer. But
one might complain of another if, when he loved us for our usefulness
or pleasantness, he pretended to love us for our character. For, as
we said at the outset, most differences arise between friends when
they are not friends in the spirit in which they think they are. So
when a man has deceived himself and has thought he was being loved
for his character, when the other person was doing nothing of the
kind, he must blame himself; when he has been deceived by the pretences
of the other person, it is just that he should complain against his
deceiver; he will complain with more justice than one does against
people who counterfeit the currency, inasmuch as the wrongdoing is
concerned with something more valuable. 

But if one accepts another man as good, and he turns out badly and
is seen to do so, must one still love him? Surely it is impossible,
since not everything can be loved, but only what is good. What is
evil neither can nor should be loved; for it is not one's duty to
be a lover of evil, nor to become like what is bad; and we have said
that like is dear like. Must the friendship, then, be forthwith broken
off? Or is this not so in all cases, but only when one's friends are
incurable in their wickedness? If they are capable of being reformed
one should rather come to the assistance of their character or their
property, inasmuch as this is better and more characteristic of friendship.
But a man who breaks off such a friendship would seem to be doing
nothing strange; for it was not to a man of this sort that he was
a friend; when his friend has changed, therefore, and he is unable
to save him, he gives him up. 

But if one friend remained the same while the other became better
and far outstripped him in virtue, should the latter treat the former
as a friend? Surely he cannot. When the interval is great this becomes
most plain, e.g. in the case of childish friendships; if one friend
remained a child in intellect while the other became a fully developed
man, how could they be friends when they neither approved of the same
things nor delighted in and were pained by the same things? For not
even with regard to each other will their tastes agree, and without
this (as we saw) they cannot be friends; for they cannot live together.
But we have discussed these matters. 

Should he, then, behave no otherwise towards him than he would if
he had never been his friend? Surely he should keep a remembrance
of their former intimacy, and as we think we ought to oblige friends
rather than strangers, so to those who have been our friends we ought
to make some allowance for our former friendship, when the breach
has not been due to excess of wickedness. 

4 

Friendly relations with one's neighbours, and the marks by which friendships
are defined, seem to have proceeded from a man's relations to himself.
For (1) we define a friend as one who wishes and does what is good,
or seems so, for the sake of his friend, or (2) as one who wishes
his friend to exist and live, for his sake; which mothers do to their
children, and friends do who have come into conflict. And (3) others
define him as one who lives with and (4) has the same tastes as another,
or (5) one who grieves and rejoices with his friend; and this too
is found in mothers most of all. It is by some one of these characterstics
that friendship too is defined. 

Now each of these is true of the good man's relation to himself (and
of all other men in so far as they think themselves good; virtue and
the good man seem, as has been said, to be the measure of every class
of things). For his opinions are harmonious, and he desires the same
things with all his soul; and therefore he wishes for himself what
is good and what seems so, and does it (for it is characteristic of
the good man to work out the good), and does so for his own sake (for
he does it for the sake of the intellectual element in him, which
is thought to be the man himself); and he wishes himself to live and
be preserved, and especially the element by virtue of which he thinks.
For existence is good to the virtuous man, and each man wishes himself
what is good, while no one chooses to possess the whole world if he
has first to become some one else (for that matter, even now God possesses
the good); he wishes for this only on condition of being whatever
he is; and the element that thinks would seem to be the individual
man, or to be so more than any other element in him. And such a man
wishes to live with himself; for he does so with pleasure, since the
memories of his past acts are delightful and his hopes for the future
are good, and therefore pleasant. His mind is well stored too with
subjects of contemplation. And he grieves and rejoices, more than
any other, with himself; for the same thing is always painful, and
the same thing always pleasant, and not one thing at one time and
another at another; he has, so to speak, nothing to repent of.

Therefore, since each of these characteristics belongs to the good
man in relation to himself, and he is related to his friend as to
himself (for his friend is another self), friendship too is thought
to be one of these attributes, and those who have these attributes
to be friends. Whether there is or is not friendship between a man
and himself is a question we may dismiss for the present; there would
seem to be friendship in so far as he is two or more, to judge from
the afore-mentioned attributes of friendship, and from the fact that
the extreme of friendship is likened to one's love for oneself.

But the attributes named seem to belong even to the majority of men,
poor creatures though they may be. Are we to say then that in so far
as they are satisfied with themselves and think they are good, they
share in these attributes? Certainly no one who is thoroughly bad
and impious has these attributes, or even seems to do so. They hardly
belong even to inferior people; for they are at variance with themselves,
and have appetites for some things and rational desires for others.
This is true, for instance, of incontinent people; for they choose,
instead of the things they themselves think good, things that are
pleasant but hurtful; while others again, through cowardice and laziness,
shrink from doing what they think best for themselves. And those who
have done many terrible deeds and are hated for their wickedness even
shrink from life and destroy themselves. And wicked men seek for people
with whom to spend their days, and shun themselves; for they remember
many a grevious deed, and anticipate others like them, when they are
by themselves, but when they are with others they forget. And having
nothing lovable in them they have no feeling of love to themselves.
Therefore also such men do not rejoice or grieve with themselves;
for their soul is rent by faction, and one element in it by reason
of its wickedness grieves when it abstains from certain acts, while
the other part is pleased, and one draws them this way and the other
that, as if they were pulling them in pieces. If a man cannot at the
same time be pained and pleased, at all events after a short time
he is pained because he was pleased, and he could have wished that
these things had not been pleasant to him; for bad men are laden with
repentance. 

Therefore the bad man does not seem to be amicably disposed even to
himself, because there is nothing in him to love; so that if to be
thus is the height of wretchedness, we should strain every nerve to
avoid wickedness and should endeavour to be good; for so and only
so can one be either friendly to oneself or a friend to another.

Goodwill is a friendly sort of relation, but is not identical with
friendship; for one may have goodwill both towards people whom one
does not know, and without their knowing it, but not friendship. This
has indeed been said already.' But goodwill is not even friendly feeling.
For it does not involve intensity or desire, whereas these accompany
friendly feeling; and friendly feeling implies intimacy while goodwill
may arise of a sudden, as it does towards competitors in a contest;
we come to feel goodwill for them and to share in their wishes, but
we would not do anything with them; for, as we said, we feel goodwill
suddenly and love them only superficially. 

Goodwill seems, then, to be a beginning of friendship, as the pleasure
of the eye is the beginning of love. For no one loves if he has not
first been delighted by the form of the beloved, but he who delights
in the form of another does not, for all that, love him, but only
does so when he also longs for him when absent and craves for his
presence; so too it is not possible for people to be friends if they
have not come to feel goodwill for each other, but those who feel
goodwill are not for all that friends; for they only wish well to
those for whom they feel goodwill, and would not do anything with
them nor take trouble for them. And so one might by an extension of
the term friendship say that goodwill is inactive friendship, though
when it is prolonged and reaches the point of intimacy it becomes
friendship-not the friendship based on utility nor that based on pleasure;
for goodwill too does not arise on those terms. The man who has received
a benefit bestows goodwill in return for what has been done to him,
but in doing so is only doing what is just; while he who wishes some
one to prosper because he hopes for enrichment through him seems to
have goodwill not to him but rather to himself, just as a man is not
a friend to another if he cherishes him for the sake of some use to
be made of him. In general, goodwill arises on account of some excellence
and worth, when one man seems to another beautiful or brave or something
of the sort, as we pointed out in the case of competitors in a contest.

6 

Unanimity also seems to be a friendly relation. For this reason it
is not identity of opinion; for that might occur even with people
who do not know each other; nor do we say that people who have the
same views on any and every subject are unanimous, e.g. those who
agree about the heavenly bodies (for unanimity about these is not
a friendly relation), but we do say that a city is unanimous when
men have the same opinion about what is to their interest, and choose
the same actions, and do what they have resolved in common. It is
about things to be done, therefore, that people are said to be unanimous,
and, among these, about matters of consequence and in which it is
possible for both or all parties to get what they want; e.g. a city
is unanimous when all its citizens think that the offices in it should
be elective, or that they should form an alliance with Sparta, or
that Pittacus should be their ruler-at a time when he himself was
also willing to rule. But when each of two people wishes himself to
have the thing in question, like the captains in the Phoenissae, they
are in a state of faction; for it is not unanimity when each of two
parties thinks of the same thing, whatever that may be, but only when
they think of the same thing in the same hands, e.g. when both the
common people and those of the better class wish the best men to rule;
for thus and thus alone do all get what they aim at. Unanimity seems,
then, to be political friendship, as indeed it is commonly said to
be; for it is concerned with things that are to our interest and have
an influence on our life. 

Now such unanimity is found among good men; for they are unanimous
both in themselves and with one another, being, so to say, of one
mind (for the wishes of such men are constant and not at the mercy
of opposing currents like a strait of the sea), and they wish for
what is just and what is advantageous, and these are the objects of
their common endeavour as well. But bad men cannot be unanimous except
to a small extent, any more than they can be friends, since they aim
at getting more than their share of advantages, while in labour and
public service they fall short of their share; and each man wishing
for advantage to himself criticizes his neighbour and stands in his
way; for if people do not watch it carefully the common weal is soon
destroyed. The result is that they are in a state of faction, putting
compulsion on each other but unwilling themselves to do what is just.

Benefactors are thought to love those they have benefited, more than
those who have been well treated love those that have treated them
well, and this is discussed as though it were paradoxical. Most people
think it is because the latter are in the position of debtors and
the former of creditors; and therefore as, in the case of loans, debtors
wish their creditors did not exist, while creditors actually take
care of the safety of their debtors, so it is thought that benefactors
wish the objects of their action to exist since they will then get
their gratitude, while the beneficiaries take no interest in making
this return. Epicharmus would perhaps declare that they say this because
they 'look at things on their bad side', but it is quite like human
nature; for most people are forgetful, and are more anxious to be
well treated than to treat others well. But the cause would seem to
be more deeply rooted in the nature of things; the case of those who
have lent money is not even analogous. For they have no friendly feeling
to their debtors, but only a wish that they may kept safe with a view
to what is to be got from them; while those who have done a service
to others feel friendship and love for those they have served even
if these are not of any use to them and never will be. This is what
happens with craftsmen too; every man loves his own handiwork better
than he would be loved by it if it came alive; and this happens perhaps
most of all with poets; for they have an excessive love for their
own poems, doting on them as if they were their children. This is
what the position of benefactors is like; for that which they have
treated well is their handiwork, and therefore they love this more
than the handiwork does its maker. The cause of this is that existence
is to all men a thing to be chosen and loved, and that we exist by
virtue of activity (i.e. by living and acting), and that the handiwork
is in a sense, the producer in activity; he loves his handiwork, therefore,
because he loves existence. And this is rooted in the nature of things;
for what he is in potentiality, his handiwork manifests in activity.

At the same time to the benefactor that is noble which depends on
his action, so that he delights in the object of his action, whereas
to the patient there is nothing noble in the agent, but at most something
advantageous, and this is less pleasant and lovable. What is pleasant
is the activity of the present, the hope of the future, the memory
of the past; but most pleasant is that which depends on activity,
and similarly this is most lovable. Now for a man who has made something
his work remains (for the noble is lasting), but for the person acted
on the utility passes away. And the memory of noble things is pleasant,
but that of useful things is not likely to be pleasant, or is less
so; though the reverse seems true of expectation. 

Further, love is like activity, being loved like passivity; and loving
and its concomitants are attributes of those who are the more active.

Again, all men love more what they have won by labour; e.g. those
who have made their money love it more than those who have inherited
it; and to be well treated seems to involve no labour, while to treat
others well is a laborious task. These are the reasons, too, why mothers
are fonder of their children than fathers; bringing them into the
world costs them more pains, and they know better that the children
are their own. This last point, too, would seem to apply to benefactors.

8 

The question is also debated, whether a man should love himself most,
or some one else. People criticize those who love themselves most,
and call them self-lovers, using this as an epithet of disgrace, and
a bad man seems to do everything for his own sake, and the more so
the more wicked he is-and so men reproach him, for instance, with
doing nothing of his own accord-while the good man acts for honour's
sake, and the more so the better he is, and acts for his friend's
sake, and sacrifices his own interest. 

But the facts clash with these arguments, and this is not surprising.
For men say that one ought to love best one's best friend, and man's
best friend is one who wishes well to the object of his wish for his
sake, even if no one is to know of it; and these attributes are found
most of all in a man's attitude towards himself, and so are all the
other attributes by which a friend is defined; for, as we have said,
it is from this relation that all the characteristics of friendship
have extended to our neighbours. All the proverbs, too, agree with
this, e.g. 'a single soul', and 'what friends have is common property',
and 'friendship is equality', and 'charity begins at home'; for all
these marks will be found most in a man's relation to himself; he
is his own best friend and therefore ought to love himself best. It
is therefore a reasonable question, which of the two views we should
follow; for both are plausible. 

Perhaps we ought to mark off such arguments from each other and determine
how far and in what respects each view is right. Now if we grasp the
sense in which each school uses the phrase 'lover of self', the truth
may become evident. Those who use the term as one of reproach ascribe
self-love to people who assign to themselves the greater share of
wealth, honours, and bodily pleasures; for these are what most people
desire, and busy themselves about as though they were the best of
all things, which is the reason, too, why they become objects of competition.
So those who are grasping with regard to these things gratify their
appetites and in general their feelings and the irrational element
of the soul; and most men are of this nature (which is the reason
why the epithet has come to be used as it is-it takes its meaning
from the prevailing type of self-love, which is a bad one); it is
just, therefore, that men who are lovers of self in this way are reproached
for being so. That it is those who give themselves the preference
in regard to objects of this sort that most people usually call lovers
of self is plain; for if a man were always anxious that he himself,
above all things, should act justly, temperately, or in accordance
with any other of the virtues, and in general were always to try to
secure for himself the honourable course, no one will call such a
man a lover of self or blame him. 

But such a man would seem more than the other a lover of self; at
all events he assigns to himself the things that are noblest and best,
and gratifies the most authoritative element in and in all things
obeys this; and just as a city or any other systematic whole is most
properly identified with the most authoritative element in it, so
is a man; and therefore the man who loves this and gratifies it is
most of all a lover of self. Besides, a man is said to have or not
to have self-control according as his reason has or has not the control,
on the assumption that this is the man himself; and the things men
have done on a rational principle are thought most properly their
own acts and voluntary acts. That this is the man himself, then, or
is so more than anything else, is plain, and also that the good man
loves most this part of him. Whence it follows that he is most truly
a lover of self, of another type than that which is a matter of reproach,
and as different from that as living according to a rational principle
is from living as passion dictates, and desiring what is noble from
desiring what seems advantageous. Those, then, who busy themselves
in an exceptional degree with noble actions all men approve and praise;
and if all were to strive towards what is noble and strain every nerve
to do the noblest deeds, everything would be as it should be for the
common weal, and every one would secure for himself the goods that
are greatest, since virtue is the greatest of goods. 

Therefore the good man should be a lover of self (for he will both
himself profit by doing noble acts, and will benefit his fellows),
but the wicked man should not; for he will hurt both himself and his
neighbours, following as he does evil passions. For the wicked man,
what he does clashes with what he ought to do, but what the good man
ought to do he does; for reason in each of its possessors chooses
what is best for itself, and the good man obeys his reason. It is
true of the good man too that he does many acts for the sake of his
friends and his country, and if necessary dies for them; for he will
throw away both wealth and honours and in general the goods that are
objects of competition, gaining for himself nobility; since he would
prefer a short period of intense pleasure to a long one of mild enjoyment,
a twelvemonth of noble life to many years of humdrum existence, and
one great and noble action to many trivial ones. Now those who die
for others doubtless attain this result; it is therefore a great prize
that they choose for themselves. They will throw away wealth too on
condition that their friends will gain more; for while a man's friend
gains wealth he himself achieves nobility; he is therefore assigning
the greater good to himself. The same too is true of honour and office;
all these things he will sacrifice to his friend; for this is noble
and laudable for himself. Rightly then is he thought to be good, since
he chooses nobility before all else. But he may even give up actions
to his friend; it may be nobler to become the cause of his friend's
acting than to act himself. In all the actions, therefore, that men
are praised for, the good man is seen to assign to himself the greater
share in what is noble. In this sense, then, as has been said, a man
should be a lover of self; but in the sense in which most men are
so, he ought not. 

9 

It is also disputed whether the happy man will need friends or not.
It is said that those who are supremely happy and self-sufficient
have no need of friends; for they have the things that are good, and
therefore being self-sufficient they need nothing further, while a
friend, being another self, furnishes what a man cannot provide by
his own effort; whence the saying 'when fortune is kind, what need
of friends?' But it seems strange, when one assigns all good things
to the happy man, not to assign friends, who are thought the greatest
of external goods. And if it is more characteristic of a friend to
do well by another than to be well done by, and to confer benefits
is characteristic of the good man and of virtue, and it is nobler
to do well by friends than by strangers, the good man will need people
to do well by. This is why the question is asked whether we need friends
more in prosperity or in adversity, on the assumption that not only
does a man in adversity need people to confer benefits on him, but
also those who are prospering need people to do well by. Surely it
is strange, too, to make the supremely happy man a solitary; for no
one would choose the whole world on condition of being alone, since
man is a political creature and one whose nature is to live with others.
Therefore even the happy man lives with others; for he has the things
that are by nature good. And plainly it is better to spend his days
with friends and good men than with strangers or any chance persons.
Therefore the happy man needs friends. 

What then is it that the first school means, and in what respect is
it right? Is it that most identify friends with useful people? Of
such friends indeed the supremely happy man will have no need, since
he already has the things that are good; nor will he need those whom
one makes one's friends because of their pleasantness, or he will
need them only to a small extent (for his life, being pleasant, has
no need of adventitious pleasure); and because he does not need such
friends he is thought not to need friends. 

But that is surely not true. For we have said at the outset that happiness
is an activity; and activity plainly comes into being and is not present
at the start like a piece of property. If (1) happiness lies in living
and being active, and the good man's activity is virtuous and pleasant
in itself, as we have said at the outset, and (2) a thing's being
one's own is one of the attributes that make it pleasant, and (3)
we can contemplate our neighbours better than ourselves and their
actions better than our own, and if the actions of virtuous men who
are their friends are pleasant to good men (since these have both
the attributes that are naturally pleasant),-if this be so, the supremely
happy man will need friends of this sort, since his purpose is to
contemplate worthy actions and actions that are his own, and the actions
of a good man who is his friend have both these qualities.

Further, men think that the happy man ought to live pleasantly. Now
if he were a solitary, life would be hard for him; for by oneself
it is not easy to be continuously active; but with others and towards
others it is easier. With others therefore his activity will be more
continuous, and it is in itself pleasant, as it ought to be for the
man who is supremely happy; for a good man qua good delights in virtuous
actions and is vexed at vicious ones, as a musical man enjoys beautiful
tunes but is pained at bad ones. A certain training in virtue arises
also from the company of the good, as Theognis has said before us.

If we look deeper into the nature of things, a virtuous friend seems
to be naturally desirable for a virtuous man. For that which is good
by nature, we have said, is for the virtuous man good and pleasant
in itself. Now life is defined in the case of animals by the power
of perception in that of man by the power of perception or thought;
and a power is defined by reference to the corresponding activity,
which is the essential thing; therefore life seems to be essentially
the act of perceiving or thinking. And life is among the things that
are good and pleasant in themselves, since it is determinate and the
determinate is of the nature of the good; and that which is good by
nature is also good for the virtuous man (which is the reason why
life seems pleasant to all men); but we must not apply this to a wicked
and corrupt life nor to a life spent in pain; for such a life is indeterminate,
as are its attributes. The nature of pain will become plainer in what
follows. But if life itself is good and pleasant (which it seems to
be, from the very fact that all men desire it, and particularly those
who are good and supremely happy; for to such men life is most desirable,
and their existence is the most supremely happy) and if he who sees
perceives that he sees, and he who hears, that he hears, and he who
walks, that he walks, and in the case of all other activities similarly
there is something which perceives that we are active, so that if
we perceive, we perceive that we perceive, and if we think, that we
think; and if to perceive that we perceive or think is to perceive
that we exist (for existence was defined as perceiving or thinking);
and if perceiving that one lives is in itself one of the things that
are pleasant (for life is by nature good, and to perceive what is
good present in oneself is pleasant); and if life is desirable, and
particularly so for good men, because to them existence is good and
pleasant for they are pleased at the consciousness of the presence
in them of what is in itself good); and if as the virtuous man is
to himself, he is to his friend also (for his friend is another self):-if
all this be true, as his own being is desirable for each man, so,
or almost so, is that of his friend. Now his being was seen to be
desirable because he perceived his own goodness, and such perception
is pleasant in itself. He needs, therefore, to be conscious of the
existence of his friend as well, and this will be realized in their
living together and sharing in discussion and thought; for this is
what living together would seem to mean in the case of man, and not,
as in the case of cattle, feeding in the same place. 

If, then, being is in itself desirable for the supremely happy man
(since it is by its nature good and pleasant), and that of his friend
is very much the same, a friend will be one of the things that are
desirable. Now that which is desirable for him he must have, or he
will be deficient in this respect. The man who is to be happy will
therefore need virtuous friends. 

10 

Should we, then, make as many friends as possible, or-as in the case
of hospitality it is thought to be suitable advice, that one should
be 'neither a man of many guests nor a man with none'-will that apply
to friendship as well; should a man neither be friendless nor have
an excessive number of friends? 

To friends made with a view to utility this saying would seem thoroughly
applicable; for to do services to many people in return is a laborious
task and life is not long enough for its performance. Therefore friends
in excess of those who are sufficient for our own life are superfluous,
and hindrances to the noble life; so that we have no need of them.
Of friends made with a view to pleasure, also, few are enough, as
a little seasoning in food is enough. 

But as regards good friends, should we have as many as possible, or
is there a limit to the number of one's friends, as there is to the
size of a city? You cannot make a city of ten men, and if there are
a hundred thousand it is a city no longer. But the proper number is
presumably not a single number, but anything that falls between certain
fixed points. So for friends too there is a fixed number perhaps the
largest number with whom one can live together (for that, we found,
thought to be very characteristic of friendship); and that one cannot
live with many people and divide oneself up among them is plain. Further,
they too must be friends of one another, if they are all to spend
their days together; and it is a hard business for this condition
to be fulfilled with a large number. It is found difficult, too, to
rejoice and to grieve in an intimate way with many people, for it
may likely happen that one has at once to be happy with one friend
and to mourn with another. Presumably, then, it is well not to seek
to have as many friends as possible, but as many as are enough for
the purpose of living together; for it would seem actually impossible
to be a great friend to many people. This is why one cannot love several
people; love is ideally a sort of excess of friendship, and that can
only be felt towards one person; therefore great friendship too can
only be felt towards a few people. This seems to be confirmed in practice;
for we do not find many people who are friends in the comradely way
of friendship, and the famous friendships of this sort are always
between two people. Those who have many friends and mix intimately
with them all are thought to be no one's friend, except in the way
proper to fellow-citizens, and such people are also called obsequious.
In the way proper to fellow-citizens, indeed, it is possible to be
the friend of many and yet not be obsequious but a genuinely good
man; but one cannot have with many people the friendship based on
virtue and on the character of our friends themselves, and we must
be content if we find even a few such. 

11 

Do we need friends more in good fortune or in bad? They are sought
after in both; for while men in adversity need help, in prosperity
they need people to live with and to make the objects of their beneficence;
for they wish to do well by others. Friendship, then, is more necessary
in bad fortune, and so it is useful friends that one wants in this
case; but it is more noble in good fortune, and so we also seek for
good men as our friends, since it is more desirable to confer benefits
on these and to live with these. For the very presence of friends
is pleasant both in good fortune and also in bad, since grief is lightened
when friends sorrow with us. Hence one might ask whether they share
as it were our burden, or-without that happening-their presence by
its pleasantness, and the thought of their grieving with us, make
our pain less. Whether it is for these reasons or for some other that
our grief is lightened, is a question that may be dismissed; at all
events what we have described appears to take place. 

But their presence seems to contain a mixture of various factors.
The very seeing of one's friends is pleasant, especially if one is
in adversity, and becomes a safeguard against grief (for a friend
tends to comfort us both by the sight of him and by his words, if
he is tactful, since he knows our character and the things that please
or pain us); but to see him pained at our misfortunes is painful;
for every one shuns being a cause of pain to his friends. For this
reason people of a manly nature guard against making their friends
grieve with them, and, unless he be exceptionally insensible to pain,
such a man cannot stand the pain that ensues for his friends, and
in general does not admit fellow-mourners because he is not himself
given to mourning; but women and womanly men enjoy sympathisers in
their grief, and love them as friends and companions in sorrow. But
in all things one obviously ought to imitate the better type of person.

On the other hand, the presence of friends in our prosperity implies
both a pleasant passing of our time and the pleasant thought of their
pleasure at our own good fortune. For this cause it would seem that
we ought to summon our friends readily to share our good fortunes
(for the beneficent character is a noble one), but summon them to
our bad fortunes with hesitation; for we ought to give them as little
a share as possible in our evils whence the saying 'enough is my misfortune'.
We should summon friends to us most of all when they are likely by
suffering a few inconveniences to do us a great service.

Conversely, it is fitting to go unasked and readily to the aid of
those in adversity (for it is characteristic of a friend to render
services, and especially to those who are in need and have not demanded
them; such action is nobler and pleasanter for both persons); but
when our friends are prosperous we should join readily in their activities
(for they need friends for these too), but be tardy in coming forward
to be the objects of their kindness; for it is not noble to be keen
to receive benefits. Still, we must no doubt avoid getting the reputation
of kill-joys by repulsing them; for that sometimes happens.

The presence of friends, then, seems desirable in all circumstances.

12 

Does it not follow, then, that, as for lovers the sight of the beloved
is the thing they love most, and they prefer this sense to the others
because on it love depends most for its being and for its origin,
so for friends the most desirable thing is living together? For friendship
is a partnership, and as a man is to himself, so is he to his friend;
now in his own case the consciousness of his being is desirable, and
so therefore is the consciousness of his friend's being, and the activity
of this consciousness is produced when they live together, so that
it is natural that they aim at this. And whatever existence means
for each class of men, whatever it is for whose sake they value life,
in that they wish to occupy themselves with their friends; and so
some drink together, others dice together, others join in athletic
exercises and hunting, or in the study of philosophy, each class spending
their days together in whatever they love most in life; for since
they wish to live with their friends, they do and share in those things
which give them the sense of living together. Thus the friendship
of bad men turns out an evil thing (for because of their instability
they unite in bad pursuits, and besides they become evil by becoming
like each other), while the friendship of good men is good, being
augmented by their companionship; and they are thought to become better
too by their activities and by improving each other; for from each
other they take the mould of the characteristics they approve-whence
the saying 'noble deeds from noble men'.-So much, then, for friendship;
our next task must be to discuss pleasure. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOK X

1 

After these matters we ought perhaps next to discuss pleasure. For
it is thought to be most intimately connected with our human nature,
which is the reason why in educating the young we steer them by the
rudders of pleasure and pain; it is thought, too, that to enjoy the
things we ought and to hate the things we ought has the greatest bearing
on virtue of character. For these things extend right through life,
with a weight and power of their own in respect both to virtue and
to the happy life, since men choose what is pleasant and avoid what
is painful; and such things, it will be thought, we should least of
all omit to discuss, especially since they admit of much dispute.
For some say pleasure is the good, while others, on the contrary,
say it is thoroughly bad-some no doubt being persuaded that the facts
are so, and others thinking it has a better effect on our life to
exhibit pleasure as a bad thing even if it is not; for most people
(they think) incline towards it and are the slaves of their pleasures,
for which reason they ought to lead them in the opposite direction,
since thus they will reach the middle state. But surely this is not
correct. For arguments about matters concerned with feelings and actions
are less reliable than facts: and so when they clash with the facts
of perception they are despised, and discredit the truth as well;
if a man who runs down pleasure is once seen to be alming at it, his
inclining towards it is thought to imply that it is all worthy of
being aimed at; for most people are not good at drawing distinctions.
True arguments seem, then, most useful, not only with a view to knowledge,
but with a view to life also; for since they harmonize with the facts
they are believed, and so they stimulate those who understand them
to live according to them.-Enough of such questions; let us proceed
to review the opinions that have been expressed about pleasure.

2 

Eudoxus thought pleasure was the good because he saw all things, both
rational and irrational, aiming at it, and because in all things that
which is the object of choice is what is excellent, and that which
is most the object of choice the greatest good; thus the fact that
all things moved towards the same object indicated that this was for
all things the chief good (for each thing, he argued, finds its own
good, as it finds its own nourishment); and that which is good for
all things and at which all aim was the good. His arguments were credited
more because of the excellence of his character than for their own
sake; he was thought to be remarkably self-controlled, and therefore
it was thought that he was not saying what he did say as a friend
of pleasure, but that the facts really were so. He believed that the
same conclusion followed no less plainly from a study of the contrary
of pleasure; pain was in itself an object of aversion to all things,
and therefore its contrary must be similarly an object of choice.
And again that is most an object of choice which we choose not because
or for the sake of something else, and pleasure is admittedly of this
nature; for no one asks to what end he is pleased, thus implying that
pleasure is in itself an object of choice. Further, he argued that
pleasure when added to any good, e.g. to just or temperate action,
makes it more worthy of choice, and that it is only by itself that
the good can be increased. 

This argument seems to show it to be one of the goods, and no more
a good than any other; for every good is more worthy of choice along
with another good than taken alone. And so it is by an argument of
this kind that Plato proves the good not to be pleasure; he argues
that the pleasant life is more desirable with wisdom than without,
and that if the mixture is better, pleasure is not the good; for the
good cannot become more desirable by the addition of anything to it.
Now it is clear that nothing else, any more than pleasure, can be
the good if it is made more desirable by the addition of any of the
things that are good in themselves. What, then, is there that satisfies
this criterion, which at the same time we can participate in? It is
something of this sort that we are looking for. Those who object that
that at which all things aim is not necessarily good are, we may surmise,
talking nonsense. For we say that that which every one thinks really
is so; and the man who attacks this belief will hardly have anything
more credible to maintain instead. If it is senseless creatures that
desire the things in question, there might be something in what they
say; but if intelligent creatures do so as well, what sense can there
be in this view? But perhaps even in inferior creatures there is some
natural good stronger than themselves which aims at their proper good.

Nor does the argument about the contrary of pleasure seem to be correct.
They say that if pain is an evil it does not follow that pleasure
is a good; for evil is opposed to evil and at the same time both are
opposed to the neutral state-which is correct enough but does not
apply to the things in question. For if both pleasure and pain belonged
to the class of evils they ought both to be objects of aversion, while
if they belonged to the class of neutrals neither should be an object
of aversion or they should both be equally so; but in fact people
evidently avoid the one as evil and choose the other as good; that
then must be the nature of the opposition between them. 

3 

Nor again, if pleasure is not a quality, does it follow that it is
not a good; for the activities of virtue are not qualities either,
nor is happiness. They say, however, that the good is determinate,
while pleasure is indeterminate, because it admits of degrees. Now
if it is from the feeling of pleasure that they judge thus, the same
will be true of justice and the other virtues, in respect of which
we plainly say that people of a certain character are so more or less,
and act more or less in accordance with these virtues; for people
may be more just or brave, and it is possible also to act justly or
temperately more or less. But if their judgement is based on the various
pleasures, surely they are not stating the real cause, if in fact
some pleasures are unmixed and others mixed. Again, just as health
admits of degrees without being indeterminate, why should not pleasure?
The same proportion is not found in all things, nor a single proportion
always in the same thing, but it may be relaxed and yet persist up
to a point, and it may differ in degree. The case of pleasure also
may therefore be of this kind. 

Again, they assume that the good is perfect while movements and comings
into being are imperfect, and try to exhibit pleasure as being a movement
and a coming into being. But they do not seem to be right even in
saying that it is a movement. For speed and slowness are thought to
be proper to every movement, and if a movement, e.g. that of the heavens,
has not speed or slowness in itself, it has it in relation to something
else; but of pleasure neither of these things is true. For while we
may become pleased quickly as we may become angry quickly, we cannot
be pleased quickly, not even in relation to some one else, while we
can walk, or grow, or the like, quickly. While, then, we can change
quickly or slowly into a state of pleasure, we cannot quickly exhibit
the activity of pleasure, i.e. be pleased. Again, how can it be a
coming into being? It is not thought that any chance thing can come
out of any chance thing, but that a thing is dissolved into that out
of which it comes into being; and pain would be the destruction of
that of which pleasure is the coming into being. 

They say, too, that pain is the lack of that which is according to
nature, and pleasure is replenishment. But these experiences are bodily.
If then pleasure is replenishment with that which is according to
nature, that which feels pleasure will be that in which the replenishment
takes place, i.e. the body; but that is not thought to be the case;
therefore the replenishment is not pleasure, though one would be pleased
when replenishment was taking place, just as one would be pained if
one was being operated on. This opinion seems to be based on the pains
and pleasures connected with nutrition; on the fact that when people
have been short of food and have felt pain beforehand they are pleased
by the replenishment. But this does not happen with all pleasures;
for the pleasures of learning and, among the sensuous pleasures, those
of smell, and also many sounds and sights, and memories and hopes,
do not presuppose pain. Of what then will these be the coming into
being? There has not been lack of anything of which they could be
the supplying anew. 

In reply to those who bring forward the disgraceful pleasures one
may say that these are not pleasant; if things are pleasant to people
of vicious constitution, we must not suppose that they are also pleasant
to others than these, just as we do not reason so about the things
that are wholesome or sweet or bitter to sick people, or ascribe whiteness
to the things that seem white to those suffering from a disease of
the eye. Or one might answer thus-that the pleasures are desirable,
but not from these sources, as wealth is desirable, but not as the
reward of betrayal, and health, but not at the cost of eating anything
and everything. Or perhaps pleasures differ in kind; for those derived
from noble sources are different from those derived from base sources,
and one cannot the pleasure of the just man without being just, nor
that of the musical man without being musical, and so on.

The fact, too, that a friend is different from a flatterer seems to
make it plain that pleasure is not a good or that pleasures are different
in kind; for the one is thought to consort with us with a view to
the good, the other with a view to our pleasure, and the one is reproached
for his conduct while the other is praised on the ground that he consorts
with us for different ends. And no one would choose to live with the
intellect of a child throughout his life, however much he were to
be pleased at the things that children are pleased at, nor to get
enjoyment by doing some most disgraceful deed, though he were never
to feel any pain in consequence. And there are many things we should
be keen about even if they brought no pleasure, e.g. seeing, remembering,
knowing, possessing the virtues. If pleasures necessarily do accompany
these, that makes no odds; we should choose these even if no pleasure
resulted. It seems to be clear, then, that neither is pleasure the
good nor is all pleasure desirable, and that some pleasures are desirable
in themselves, differing in kind or in their sources from the others.
So much for the things that are said about pleasure and pain.

What pleasure is, or what kind of thing it is, will become plainer
if we take up the question aga from the beginning. Seeing seems to
be at any moment complete, for it does not lack anything which coming
into being later will complete its form; and pleasure also seems to
be of this nature. For it is a whole, and at no time can one find
a pleasure whose form will be completed if the pleasure lasts longer.
For this reason, too, it is not a movement. For every movement (e.g.
that of building) takes time and is for the sake of an end, and is
complete when it has made what it aims at. It is complete, therefore,
only in the whole time or at that final moment. In their parts and
during the time they occupy, all movements are incomplete, and are
different in kind from the whole movement and from each other. For
the fitting together of the stones is different from the fluting of
the column, and these are both different from the making of the temple;
and the making of the temple is complete (for it lacks nothing with
a view to the end proposed), but the making of the base or of the
triglyph is incomplete; for each is the making of only a part. They
differ in kind, then, and it is not possible to find at any and every
time a movement complete in form, but if at all, only in the whole
time. So, too, in the case of walking and all other movements. For
if locomotion is a movement from to there, it, too, has differences
in kind-flying, walking, leaping, and so on. And not only so, but
in walking itself there are such differences; for the whence and whither
are not the same in the whole racecourse and in a part of it, nor
in one part and in another, nor is it the same thing to traverse this
line and that; for one traverses not only a line but one which is
in a place, and this one is in a different place from that. We have
discussed movement with precision in another work, but it seems that
it is not complete at any and every time, but that the many movements
are incomplete and different in kind, since the whence and whither
give them their form. But of pleasure the form is complete at any
and every time. Plainly, then, pleasure and movement must be different
from each other, and pleasure must be one of the things that are whole
and complete. This would seem to be the case, too, from the fact that
it is not possible to move otherwise than in time, but it is possible
to be pleased; for that which takes place in a moment is a whole.

From these considerations it is clear, too, that these thinkers are
not right in saying there is a movement or a coming into being of
pleasure. For these cannot be ascribed to all things, but only to
those that are divisible and not wholes; there is no coming into being
of seeing nor of a point nor of a unit, nor is any of these a movement
or coming into being; therefore there is no movement or coming into
being of pleasure either; for it is a whole. 

Since every sense is active in relation to its object, and a sense
which is in good condition acts perfectly in relation to the most
beautiful of its objects (for perfect activity seems to be ideally
of this nature; whether we say that it is active, or the organ in
which it resides, may be assumed to be immaterial), it follows that
in the case of each sense the best activity is that of the best-conditioned
organ in relation to the finest of its objects. And this activity
will be the most complete and pleasant. For, while there is pleasure
in respect of any sense, and in respect of thought and contemplation
no less, the most complete is pleasantest, and that of a well-conditioned
organ in relation to the worthiest of its objects is the most complete;
and the pleasure completes the activity. But the pleasure does not
complete it in the same way as the combination of object and sense,
both good, just as health and the doctor are not in the same way the
cause of a man's being healthy. (That pleasure is produced in respect
to each sense is plain; for we speak of sights and sounds as pleasant.
It is also plain that it arises most of all when both the sense is
at its best and it is active in reference to an object which corresponds;
when both object and perceiver are of the best there will always be
pleasure, since the requisite agent and patient are both present.)
Pleasure completes the activity not as the corresponding permanent
state does, by its immanence, but as an end which supervenes as the
bloom of youth does on those in the flower of their age. So long,
then, as both the intelligible or sensible object and the discriminating
or contemplative faculty are as they should be, the pleasure will
be involved in the activity; for when both the passive and the active
factor are unchanged and are related to each other in the same way,
the same result naturally follows. 

How, then, is it that no one is continuously pleased? Is it that we
grow weary? Certainly all human beings are incapable of continuous
activity. Therefore pleasure also is not continuous; for it accompanies
activity. Some things delight us when they are new, but later do so
less, for the same reason; for at first the mind is in a state of
stimulation and intensely active about them, as people are with respect
to their vision when they look hard at a thing, but afterwards our
activity is not of this kind, but has grown relaxed; for which reason
the pleasure also is dulled. 

One might think that all men desire pleasure because they all aim
at life; life is an activity, and each man is active about those things
and with those faculties that he loves most; e.g. the musician is
active with his hearing in reference to tunes, the student with his
mind in reference to theoretical questions, and so on in each case;
now pleasure completes the activities, and therefore life, which they
desire. It is with good reason, then, that they aim at pleasure too,
since for every one it completes life, which is desirable. But whether
we choose life for the sake of pleasure or pleasure for the sake of
life is a question we may dismiss for the present. For they seem to
be bound up together and not to admit of separation, since without
activity pleasure does not arise, and every activity is completed
by the attendant pleasure. 

5 

For this reason pleasures seem, too, to differ in kind. For things
different in kind are, we think, completed by different things (we
see this to be true both of natural objects and of things produced
by art, e.g. animals, trees, a painting, a sculpture, a house, an
implement); and, similarly, we think that activities differing in
kind are completed by things differing in kind. Now the activities
of thought differ from those of the senses, and both differ among
themselves, in kind; so, therefore, do the pleasures that complete
them. 

This may be seen, too, from the fact that each of the pleasures is
bound up with the activity it completes. For an activity is intensified
by its proper pleasure, since each class of things is better judged
of and brought to precision by those who engage in the activity with
pleasure; e.g. it is those who enjoy geometrical thinking that become
geometers and grasp the various propositions better, and, similarly,
those who are fond of music or of building, and so on, make progress
in their proper function by enjoying it; so the pleasures intensify
the activities, and what intensifies a thing is proper to it, but
things different in kind have properties different in kind.

This will be even more apparent from the fact that activities are
hindered by pleasures arising from other sources. For people who are
fond of playing the flute are incapable of attending to arguments
if they overhear some one playing the flute, since they enjoy flute-playing
more than the activity in hand; so the pleasure connected with fluteplaying
destroys the activity concerned with argument. This happens, similarly,
in all other cases, when one is active about two things at once; the
more pleasant activity drives out the other, and if it is much more
pleasant does so all the more, so that one even ceases from the other.
This is why when we enjoy anything very much we do not throw ourselves
into anything else, and do one thing only when we are not much pleased
by another; e.g. in the theatre the people who eat sweets do so most
when the actors are poor. Now since activities are made precise and
more enduring and better by their proper pleasure, and injured by
alien pleasures, evidently the two kinds of pleasure are far apart.
For alien pleasures do pretty much what proper pains do, since activities
are destroyed by their proper pains; e.g. if a man finds writing or
doing sums unpleasant and painful, he does not write, or does not
do sums, because the activity is painful. So an activity suffers contrary
effects from its proper pleasures and pains, i.e. from those that
supervene on it in virtue of its own nature. And alien pleasures have
been stated to do much the same as pain; they destroy the activity,
only not to the same degree. 

Now since activities differ in respect of goodness and badness, and
some are worthy to be chosen, others to be avoided, and others neutral,
so, too, are the pleasures; for to each activity there is a proper
pleasure. The pleasure proper to a worthy activity is good and that
proper to an unworthy activity bad; just as the appetites for noble
objects are laudable, those for base objects culpable. But the pleasures
involved in activities are more proper to them than the desires; for
the latter are separated both in time and in nature, while the former
are close to the activities, and so hard to distinguish from them
that it admits of dispute whether the activity is not the same as
the pleasure. (Still, pleasure does not seem to be thought or perception-that
would be strange; but because they are not found apart they appear
to some people the same.) As activities are different, then, so are
the corresponding pleasures. Now sight is superior to touch in purity,
and hearing and smell to taste; the pleasures, therefore, are similarly
superior, and those of thought superior to these, and within each
of the two kinds some are superior to others. 

Each animal is thought to have a proper pleasure, as it has a proper
function; viz. that which corresponds to its activity. If we survey
them species by species, too, this will be evident; horse, dog, and
man have different pleasures, as Heraclitus says 'asses would prefer
sweepings to gold'; for food is pleasanter than gold to asses. So
the pleasures of creatures different in kind differ in kind, and it
is plausible to suppose that those of a single species do not differ.
But they vary to no small extent, in the case of men at least; the
same things delight some people and pain others, and are painful and
odious to some, and pleasant to and liked by others. This happens,
too, in the case of sweet things; the same things do not seem sweet
to a man in a fever and a healthy man-nor hot to a weak man and one
in good condition. The same happens in other cases. But in all such
matters that which appears to the good man is thought to be really
so. If this is correct, as it seems to be, and virtue and the good
man as such are the measure of each thing, those also will be pleasures
which appear so to him, and those things pleasant which he enjoys.
If the things he finds tiresome seem pleasant to some one, that is
nothing surprising; for men may be ruined and spoilt in many ways;
but the things are not pleasant, but only pleasant to these people
and to people in this condition. Those which are admittedly disgraceful
plainly should not be said to be pleasures, except to a perverted
taste; but of those that are thought to be good what kind of pleasure
or what pleasure should be said to be that proper to man? Is it not
plain from the corresponding activities? The pleasures follow these.
Whether, then, the perfect and supremely happy man has one or more
activities, the pleasures that perfect these will be said in the strict
sense to be pleasures proper to man, and the rest will be so in a
secondary and fractional way, as are the activities. 

6 

Now that we have spoken of the virtues, the forms of friendship, and
the varieties of pleasure, what remains is to discuss in outline the
nature of happiness, since this is what we state the end of human
nature to be. Our discussion will be the more concise if we first
sum up what we have said already. We said, then, that it is not a
disposition; for if it were it might belong to some one who was asleep
throughout his life, living the life of a plant, or, again, to some
one who was suffering the greatest misfortunes. If these implications
are unacceptable, and we must rather class happiness as an activity,
as we have said before, and if some activities are necessary, and
desirable for the sake of something else, while others are so in themselves,
evidently happiness must be placed among those desirable in themselves,
not among those desirable for the sake of something else; for happiness
does not lack anything, but is self-sufficient. Now those activities
are desirable in themselves from which nothing is sought beyond the
activity. And of this nature virtuous actions are thought to be; for
to do noble and good deeds is a thing desirable for its own sake.

Pleasant amusements also are thought to be of this nature; we choose
them not for the sake of other things; for we are injured rather than
benefited by them, since we are led to neglect our bodies and our
property. But most of the people who are deemed happy take refuge
in such pastimes, which is the reason why those who are ready-witted
at them are highly esteemed at the courts of tyrants; they make themselves
pleasant companions in the tyrants' favourite pursuits, and that is
the sort of man they want. Now these things are thought to be of the
nature of happiness because people in despotic positions spend their
leisure in them, but perhaps such people prove nothing; for virtue
and reason, from which good activities flow, do not depend on despotic
position; nor, if these people, who have never tasted pure and generous
pleasure, take refuge in the bodily pleasures, should these for that
reason be thought more desirable; for boys, too, think the things
that are valued among themselves are the best. It is to be expected,
then, that, as different things seem valuable to boys and to men,
so they should to bad men and to good. Now, as we have often maintained,
those things are both valuable and pleasant which are such to the
good man; and to each man the activity in accordance with his own
disposition is most desirable, and, therefore, to the good man that
which is in accordance with virtue. Happiness, therefore, does not
lie in amusement; it would, indeed, be strange if the end were amusement,
and one were to take trouble and suffer hardship all one's life in
order to amuse oneself. For, in a word, everything that we choose
we choose for the sake of something else-except happiness, which is
an end. Now to exert oneself and work for the sake of amusement seems
silly and utterly childish. But to amuse oneself in order that one
may exert oneself, as Anacharsis puts it, seems right; for amusement
is a sort of relaxation, and we need relaxation because we cannot
work continuously. Relaxation, then, is not an end; for it is taken
for the sake of activity. 

The happy life is thought to be virtuous; now a virtuous life requires
exertion, and does not consist in amusement. And we say that serious
things are better than laughable things and those connected with amusement,
and that the activity of the better of any two things-whether it be
two elements of our being or two men-is the more serious; but the
activity of the better is ipso facto superior and more of the nature
of happiness. And any chance person-even a slave-can enjoy the bodily
pleasures no less than the best man; but no one assigns to a slave
a share in happiness-unless he assigns to him also a share in human
life. For happiness does not lie in such occupations, but, as we have
said before, in virtuous activities. 

7 

If happiness is activity in accordance with virtue, it is reasonable
that it should be in accordance with the highest virtue; and this
will be that of the best thing in us. Whether it be reason or something
else that is this element which is thought to be our natural ruler
and guide and to take thought of things noble and divine, whether
it be itself also divine or only the most divine element in us, the
activity of this in accordance with its proper virtue will be perfect
happiness. That this activity is contemplative we have already said.

Now this would seem to be in agreement both with what we said before
and with the truth. For, firstly, this activity is the best (since
not only is reason the best thing in us, but the objects of reason
are the best of knowable objects); and secondly, it is the most continuous,
since we can contemplate truth more continuously than we can do anything.
And we think happiness has pleasure mingled with it, but the activity
of philosophic wisdom is admittedly the pleasantest of virtuous activities;
at all events the pursuit of it is thought to offer pleasures marvellous
for their purity and their enduringness, and it is to be expected
that those who know will pass their time more pleasantly than those
who inquire. And the self-sufficiency that is spoken of must belong
most to the contemplative activity. For while a philosopher, as well
as a just man or one possessing any other virtue, needs the necessaries
of life, when they are sufficiently equipped with things of that sort
the just man needs people towards whom and with whom he shall act
justly, and the temperate man, the brave man, and each of the others
is in the same case, but the philosopher, even when by himself, can
contemplate truth, and the better the wiser he is; he can perhaps
do so better if he has fellow-workers, but still he is the most self-sufficient.
And this activity alone would seem to be loved for its own sake; for
nothing arises from it apart from the contemplating, while from practical
activities we gain more or less apart from the action. And happiness
is thought to depend on leisure; for we are busy that we may have
leisure, and make war that we may live in peace. Now the activity
of the practical virtues is exhibited in political or military affairs,
but the actions concerned with these seem to be unleisurely. Warlike
actions are completely so (for no one chooses to be at war, or provokes
war, for the sake of being at war; any one would seem absolutely murderous
if he were to make enemies of his friends in order to bring about
battle and slaughter); but the action of the statesman is also unleisurely,
and-apart from the political action itself-aims at despotic power
and honours, or at all events happiness, for him and his fellow citizens-a
happiness different from political action, and evidently sought as
being different. So if among virtuous actions political and military
actions are distinguished by nobility and greatness, and these are
unleisurely and aim at an end and are not desirable for their own
sake, but the activity of reason, which is contemplative, seems both
to be superior in serious worth and to aim at no end beyond itself,
and to have its pleasure proper to itself (and this augments the activity),
and the self-sufficiency, leisureliness, unweariedness (so far as
this is possible for man), and all the other attributes ascribed to
the supremely happy man are evidently those connected with this activity,
it follows that this will be the complete happiness of man, if it
be allowed a complete term of life (for none of the attributes of
happiness is incomplete). 

But such a life would be too high for man; for it is not in so far
as he is man that he will live so, but in so far as something divine
is present in him; and by so much as this is superior to our composite
nature is its activity superior to that which is the exercise of the
other kind of virtue. If reason is divine, then, in comparison with
man, the life according to it is divine in comparison with human life.
But we must not follow those who advise us, being men, to think of
human things, and, being mortal, of mortal things, but must, so far
as we can, make ourselves immortal, and strain every nerve to live
in accordance with the best thing in us; for even if it be small in
bulk, much more does it in power and worth surpass everything. This
would seem, too, to be each man himself, since it is the authoritative
and better part of him. It would be strange, then, if he were to choose
not the life of his self but that of something else. And what we said
before' will apply now; that which is proper to each thing is by nature
best and most pleasant for each thing; for man, therefore, the life
according to reason is best and pleasantest, since reason more than
anything else is man. This life therefore is also the happiest.

8 

But in a secondary degree the life in accordance with the other kind
of virtue is happy; for the activities in accordance with this befit
our human estate. Just and brave acts, and other virtuous acts, we
do in relation to each other, observing our respective duties with
regard to contracts and services and all manner of actions and with
regard to passions; and all of these seem to be typically human. Some
of them seem even to arise from the body, and virtue of character
to be in many ways bound up with the passions. Practical wisdom, too,
is linked to virtue of character, and this to practical wisdom, since
the principles of practical wisdom are in accordance with the moral
virtues and rightness in morals is in accordance with practical wisdom.
Being connected with the passions also, the moral virtues must belong
to our composite nature; and the virtues of our composite nature are
human; so, therefore, are the life and the happiness which correspond
to these. The excellence of the reason is a thing apart; we must be
content to say this much about it, for to describe it precisely is
a task greater than our purpose requires. It would seem, however,
also to need external equipment but little, or less than moral virtue
does. Grant that both need the necessaries, and do so equally, even
if the statesman's work is the more concerned with the body and things
of that sort; for there will be little difference there; but in what
they need for the exercise of their activities there will be much
difference. The liberal man will need money for the doing of his liberal
deeds, and the just man too will need it for the returning of services
(for wishes are hard to discern, and even people who are not just
pretend to wish to act justly); and the brave man will need power
if he is to accomplish any of the acts that correspond to his virtue,
and the temperate man will need opportunity; for how else is either
he or any of the others to be recognized? It is debated, too, whether
the will or the deed is more essential to virtue, which is assumed
to involve both; it is surely clear that its perfection involves both;
but for deeds many things are needed, and more, the greater and nobler
the deeds are. But the man who is contemplating the truth needs no
such thing, at least with a view to the exercise of his activity;
indeed they are, one may say, even hindrances, at all events to his
contemplation; but in so far as he is a man and lives with a number
of people, he chooses to do virtuous acts; he will therefore need
such aids to living a human life. 

But that perfect happiness is a contemplative activity will appear
from the following consideration as well. We assume the gods to be
above all other beings blessed and happy; but what sort of actions
must we assign to them? Acts of justice? Will not the gods seem absurd
if they make contracts and return deposits, and so on? Acts of a brave
man, then, confronting dangers and running risks because it is noble
to do so? Or liberal acts? To whom will they give? It will be strange
if they are really to have money or anything of the kind. And what
would their temperate acts be? Is not such praise tasteless, since
they have no bad appetites? If we were to run through them all, the
circumstances of action would be found trivial and unworthy of gods.
Still, every one supposes that they live and therefore that they are
active; we cannot suppose them to sleep like Endymion. Now if you
take away from a living being action, and still more production, what
is left but contemplation? Therefore the activity of God, which surpasses
all others in blessedness, must be contemplative; and of human activities,
therefore, that which is most akin to this must be most of the nature
of happiness. 

This is indicated, too, by the fact that the other animals have no
share in happiness, being completely deprived of such activity. For
while the whole life of the gods is blessed, and that of men too in
so far as some likeness of such activity belongs to them, none of
the other animals is happy, since they in no way share in contemplation.
Happiness extends, then, just so far as contemplation does, and those
to whom contemplation more fully belongs are more truly happy, not
as a mere concomitant but in virtue of the contemplation; for this
is in itself precious. Happiness, therefore, must be some form of
contemplation. 

But, being a man, one will also need external prosperity; for our
nature is not self-sufficient for the purpose of contemplation, but
our body also must be healthy and must have food and other attention.
Still, we must not think that the man who is to be happy will need
many things or great things, merely because he cannot be supremely
happy without external goods; for self-sufficiency and action do not
involve excess, and we can do noble acts without ruling earth and
sea; for even with moderate advantages one can act virtuously (this
is manifest enough; for private persons are thought to do worthy acts
no less than despots-indeed even more); and it is enough that we should
have so much as that; for the life of the man who is active in accordance
with virtue will be happy. Solon, too, was perhaps sketching well
the happy man when he described him as moderately furnished with externals
but as having done (as Solon thought) the noblest acts, and lived
temperately; for one can with but moderate possessions do what one
ought. Anaxagoras also seems to have supposed the happy man not to
be rich nor a despot, when he said that he would not be surprised
if the happy man were to seem to most people a strange person; for
they judge by externals, since these are all they perceive. The opinions
of the wise seem, then, to harmonize with our arguments. But while
even such things carry some conviction, the truth in practical matters
is discerned from the facts of life; for these are the decisive factor.
We must therefore survey what we have already said, bringing it to
the test of the facts of life, and if it harmonizes with the facts
we must accept it, but if it clashes with them we must suppose it
to be mere theory. Now he who exercises his reason and cultivates
it seems to be both in the best state of mind and most dear to the
gods. For if the gods have any care for human affairs, as they are
thought to have, it would be reasonable both that they should delight
in that which was best and most akin to them (i.e. reason) and that
they should reward those who love and honour this most, as caring
for the things that are dear to them and acting both rightly and nobly.
And that all these attributes belong most of all to the philosopher
is manifest. He, therefore, is the dearest to the gods. And he who
is that will presumably be also the happiest; so that in this way
too the philosopher will more than any other be happy.

If these matters and the virtues, and also friendship and pleasure,
have been dealt with sufficiently in outline, are we to suppose that
our programme has reached its end? Surely, as the saying goes, where
there are things to be done the end is not to survey and recognize
the various things, but rather to do them; with regard to virtue,
then, it is not enough to know, but we must try to have and use it,
or try any other way there may be of becoming good. Now if arguments
were in themselves enough to make men good, they would justly, as
Theognis says, have won very great rewards, and such rewards should
have been provided; but as things are, while they seem to have power
to encourage and stimulate the generous-minded among our youth, and
to make a character which is gently born, and a true lover of what
is noble, ready to be possessed by virtue, they are not able to encourage
the many to nobility and goodness. For these do not by nature obey
the sense of shame, but only fear, and do not abstain from bad acts
because of their baseness but through fear of punishment; living by
passion they pursue their own pleasures and the means to them, and
and the opposite pains, and have not even a conception of what is
noble and truly pleasant, since they have never tasted it. What argument
would remould such people? It is hard, if not impossible, to remove
by argument the traits that have long since been incorporated in the
character; and perhaps we must be content if, when all the influences
by which we are thought to become good are present, we get some tincture
of virtue. 

Now some think that we are made good by nature, others by habituation,
others by teaching. Nature's part evidently does not depend on us,
but as a result of some divine causes is present in those who are
truly fortunate; while argument and teaching, we may suspect, are
not powerful with all men, but the soul of the student must first
have been cultivated by means of habits for noble joy and noble hatred,
like earth which is to nourish the seed. For he who lives as passion
directs will not hear argument that dissuades him, nor understand
it if he does; and how can we persuade one in such a state to change
his ways? And in general passion seems to yield not to argument but
to force. The character, then, must somehow be there already with
a kinship to virtue, loving what is noble and hating what is base.

But it is difficult to get from youth up a right training for virtue
if one has not been brought up under right laws; for to live temperately
and hardily is not pleasant to most people, especially when they are
young. For this reason their nurture and occupations should be fixed
by law; for they will not be painful when they have become customary.
But it is surely not enough that when they are young they should get
the right nurture and attention; since they must, even when they are
grown up, practise and be habituated to them, we shall need laws for
this as well, and generally speaking to cover the whole of life; for
most people obey necessity rather than argument, and punishments rather
than the sense of what is noble. 

This is why some think that legislators ought to stimulate men to
virtue and urge them forward by the motive of the noble, on the assumption
that those who have been well advanced by the formation of habits
will attend to such influences; and that punishments and penalties
should be imposed on those who disobey and are of inferior nature,
while the incurably bad should be completely banished. A good man
(they think), since he lives with his mind fixed on what is noble,
will submit to argument, while a bad man, whose desire is for pleasure,
is corrected by pain like a beast of burden. This is, too, why they
say the pains inflicted should be those that are most opposed to the
pleasures such men love. 

However that may be, if (as we have said) the man who is to be good
must be well trained and habituated, and go on to spend his time in
worthy occupations and neither willingly nor unwillingly do bad actions,
and if this can be brought about if men live in accordance with a
sort of reason and right order, provided this has force,-if this be
so, the paternal command indeed has not the required force or compulsive
power (nor in general has the command of one man, unless he be a king
or something similar), but the law has compulsive power, while it
is at the same time a rule proceeding from a sort of practical wisdom
and reason. And while people hate men who oppose their impulses, even
if they oppose them rightly, the law in its ordaining of what is good
is not burdensome. 

In the Spartan state alone, or almost alone, the legislator seems
to have paid attention to questions of nurture and occupations; in
most states such matters have been neglected, and each man lives as
he pleases, Cyclops-fashion, 'to his own wife and children dealing
law'. Now it is best that there should be a public and proper care
for such matters; but if they are neglected by the community it would
seem right for each man to help his children and friends towards virtue,
and that they should have the power, or at least the will, to do this.

It would seem from what has been said that he can do this better if
he makes himself capable of legislating. For public control is plainly
effected by laws, and good control by good laws; whether written or
unwritten would seem to make no difference, nor whether they are laws
providing for the education of individuals or of groups-any more than
it does in the case of music or gymnastics and other such pursuits.
For as in cities laws and prevailing types of character have force,
so in households do the injunctions and the habits of the father,
and these have even more because of the tie of blood and the benefits
he confers; for the children start with a natural affection and disposition
to obey. Further, private education has an advantage over public,
as private medical treatment has; for while in general rest and abstinence
from food are good for a man in a fever, for a particular man they
may not be; and a boxer presumably does not prescribe the same style
of fighting to all his pupils. It would seem, then, that the detail
is worked out with more precision if the control is private; for each
person is more likely to get what suits his case. 

But the details can be best looked after, one by one, by a doctor
or gymnastic instructor or any one else who has the general knowledge
of what is good for every one or for people of a certain kind (for
the sciences both are said to be, and are, concerned with what is
universal); not but what some particular detail may perhaps be well
looked after by an unscientific person, if he has studied accurately
in the light of experience what happens in each case, just as some
people seem to be their own best doctors, though they could give no
help to any one else. None the less, it will perhaps be agreed that
if a man does wish to become master of an art or science he must go
to the universal, and come to know it as well as possible; for, as
we have said, it is with this that the sciences are concerned.

And surely he who wants to make men, whether many or few, better by
his care must try to become capable of legislating, if it is through
laws that we can become good. For to get any one whatever-any one
who is put before us-into the right condition is not for the first
chance comer; if any one can do it, it is the man who knows, just
as in medicine and all other matters which give scope for care and
prudence. 

Must we not, then, next examine whence or how one can learn how to
legislate? Is it, as in all other cases, from statesmen? Certainly
it was thought to be a part of statesmanship. Or is a difference apparent
between statesmanship and the other sciences and arts? In the others
the same people are found offering to teach the arts and practising
them, e.g. doctors or painters; but while the sophists profess to
teach politics, it is practised not by any of them but by the politicians,
who would seem to do so by dint of a certain skill and experience
rather than of thought; for they are not found either writing or speaking
about such matters (though it were a nobler occupation perhaps than
composing speeches for the law-courts and the assembly), nor again
are they found to have made statesmen of their own sons or any other
of their friends. But it was to be expected that they should if they
could; for there is nothing better than such a skill that they could
have left to their cities, or could prefer to have for themselves,
or, therefore, for those dearest to them. Still, experience seems
to contribute not a little; else they could not have become politicians
by familiarity with politics; and so it seems that those who aim at
knowing about the art of politics need experience as well.

But those of the sophists who profess the art seem to be very far
from teaching it. For, to put the matter generally, they do not even
know what kind of thing it is nor what kinds of things it is about;
otherwise they would not have classed it as identical with rhetoric
or even inferior to it, nor have thought it easy to legislate by collecting
the laws that are thought well of; they say it is possible to select
the best laws, as though even the selection did not demand intelligence
and as though right judgement were not the greatest thing, as in matters
of music. For while people experienced in any department judge rightly
the works produced in it, and understand by what means or how they
are achieved, and what harmonizes with what, the inexperienced must
be content if they do not fail to see whether the work has been well
or ill made-as in the case of painting. Now laws are as it were the'
works' of the political art; how then can one learn from them to be
a legislator, or judge which are best? Even medical men do not seem
to be made by a study of text-books. Yet people try, at any rate,
to state not only the treatments, but also how particular classes
of people can be cured and should be treated-distinguishing the various
habits of body; but while this seems useful to experienced people,
to the inexperienced it is valueless. Surely, then, while collections
of laws, and of constitutions also, may be serviceable to those who
can study them and judge what is good or bad and what enactments suit
what circumstances, those who go through such collections without
a practised faculty will not have right judgement (unless it be as
a spontaneous gift of nature), though they may perhaps become more
intelligent in such matters. 

Now our predecessors have left the subject of legislation to us unexamined;
it is perhaps best, therefore, that we should ourselves study it,
and in general study the question of the constitution, in order to
complete to the best of our ability our philosophy of human nature.
First, then, if anything has been said well in detail by earlier thinkers,
let us try to review it; then in the light of the constitutions we
have collected let us study what sorts of influence preserve and destroy
states, and what sorts preserve or destroy the particular kinds of
constitution, and to what causes it is due that some are well and
others ill administered. When these have been studied we shall perhaps
be more likely to see with a comprehensive view, which constitution
is best, and how each must be ordered, and what laws and customs it
must use, if it is to be at its best. Let us make a beginning of our
discussion. 

THE END
